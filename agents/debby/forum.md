> Niche forums + subreddits + Discord servers + slack groups where target customers hang out.

Niche forums + subreddits + Discord servers + slack groups where target customers hang out. Input: niche. Output: 10-20 venues with engagement templates (first post, value-first intro, soft mention). Standard: 0.03 USDC.

## Role

Niche forums + subreddits + Discord servers + slack groups where target customers hang out. Input: niche.

Part of **Debby Agency Pod** — an 11-agent marketing team ingested from Debby's
`debby-marketing` repo. Runs natively on the ONE substrate with Debby's
prompts, prices, and self-review rules intact. The substrate routes work to it
via pheromone; the same markdown file also ships to Fetch.ai Agentverse for
ASI:One discovery. No Python bridge — the prompt lives in this file and calls
through `complete()` via OpenRouter on every request.

**Upstream — agents that feed this one**

| Upstream agent | Why it feeds here |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `debby:citation` | NAP data feeds outreach venues |

**Downstream — agents this one feeds**

| Downstream agent | Why it fans out |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `debby:outreach` | discovers venues, works them |

Every edge above is pre-seeded in TypeDB at `strength=50` from Debby's
`alliances.yaml` cross-holding (50 USDC per pair). The substrate starts with a
warm graph — no cold-start — and updates strengths from real traffic.

## The prompt (lifted verbatim from Donal)

This is the gold. Do not paraphrase, do not summarize. When the substrate calls
this agent, `complete()` is invoked with the text below as the system prompt,
with `{fee}`, `{domain}`, `{context}` placeholders filled at call time.

```
You are the OO Forum Finder agent. A caller paid {fee} USDC.

NICHE: {niche}
CONTEXT: {context}

Return 10-20 forums, subreddits, Discord servers, Slack groups, or Facebook groups where target customers in this niche actively discuss problems. Format:

## [N]. [Venue Name] - [Platform]
**URL:** [direct link]
**Active users:** [estimate]
**Activity:** [posts/day]
**Engagement rule:** [value-first, no promotion, link whitelist, etc.]
**First-post template:** [150-word intro that establishes credibility without pitching]
**Value-drop angle:** [topic to post about that solves a real problem + naturally leads to the business]

No em dashes. No spammy angles. Under 1500 words.
```


## Hard rules (from `debby-marketing/common/wrapper.py::self_review`)

Every response passes through three deterministic checks before returning:

- **No em dashes.** Debby's house style rejects `—` anywhere in output.
- **No placeholder text.** No `[PHONE]`, `[EMAIL]`, `[INSERT …]`, `[PLACEHOLDER]`.
- **No hedging.** Ban `it depends`, `might be`, `could potentially`.

`confidence = 1.0 - 0.25 × violations`. Below 0.7 triggers one revision attempt,
then warns in metadata. The substrate consumes this grade as a `mark` / `warn`
signal that accumulates on the path from caller to this agent.

## Signal conventions

How other agents call this one through the substrate:

```typescript
// From CMO or an upstream agent
net.signal({
  receiver: 'debby:forum',
  data: {
    input: '...',       // domain, niche, brief — per the prompt
    context: { ... },   // client profile, past audits, etc.
    tier: 'standard',   // or 'deep'
    caller_addr: ctx.from,
    payment_tx: 'sui:...',
  },
})
```

Fan-out to downstream agents after completion:

```typescript
emit({ receiver: 'debby:outreach', data: result })  // discovers venues, works them
```


## Pricing

| Tier     | Fee  | When it fires |
|----------|-----:|---------------|
| standard | 0.03 USDC | cheap entry-point — discovery agent |


Paid in USDC via x402 on Agentverse; paid in stablecoin on ONE substrate. The
same agent settles either way through its Sui wallet (derived from
`SUI_SEED + debby:forum` — no private keys stored).
