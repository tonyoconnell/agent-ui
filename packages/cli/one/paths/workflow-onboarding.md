# ONE Platform Onboarding Workflow

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Purpose:** Complete user journey from `npx oneie init` to deployed website
**Paradigm:** Cycle-based execution (not time-based)

---

## The Complete Journey

```
1. Init (1 min)
   ↓
2. Profile Setup (2 min)
   ↓
3. AI Website Analysis (30 sec)
   ↓
4. Custom Ontology Generation (30 sec)
   ↓
5. Feature Selection (2 min)
   ↓
6. Cycle Plan Generation (10 sec)
   ↓
7. Landing Page Deploy (Cycle 1-10, ~5 min)
   ↓
8. Full Site Build (Cycle 11-100, ~30-60 min)
   ↓
9. Live Production Site ✨
```

**Total Time:** ~45-75 minutes from zero to production

---

## Phase 1: Init & Profile Setup

### Step 1: `npx oneie init`

```bash
$ npx oneie init

     ██████╗ ███╗   ██╗███████╗
    ██╔═══██╗████╗  ██║██╔════╝
    ██║   ██║██╔██╗ ██║█████╗
    ██║   ██║██║╚██╗██║██╔══╝
    ╚██████╔╝██║ ╚████║███████╗
     ╚═════╝ ╚═╝  ╚═══╝╚══════╝

       Make Your Ideas Real

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Welcome! Let's build your platform.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

? What's your name? › Tom O'Connor
? Organization name? › ONE Platform
? What's your current website? › https://one.ie
? What email should we use? › tom@one.ie

✨ Perfect! Starting Claude Code to analyze your website...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🤖 Launching Claude Code
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

$ claude

Claude Code initialized. Running command:
$ /one analyze https://one.ie --org "ONE Platform" --email tom@one.ie
```

**Creates:**
- `.env.local` with user details
- Installation folder: `/one-platform/`
- Initial group structure

### Step 2: Website Analysis (Claude Code + agent-onboard)

```bash
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🤖 CLAUDE CODE ACTIVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Running: /one analyze https://one.ie

agent-onboard is analyzing your website...

[WebFetch] Fetching https://one.ie
[WebFetch] Analyzing HTML, CSS, and content
[WebFetch] Extracting brand identity

✅ Detected:
   • Primary color: #FF6B6B (Coral)
   • Secondary color: #4ECDC4 (Teal)
   • Logo: /logo.svg
   • Brand voice: Technical, friendly, empowering
   • Target audience: Developers, creators, entrepreneurs
   • Existing platform: Yes (Astro + Convex)

✅ Extracted features:
   • Multi-tenant architecture
   • AI agent integration
   • Creator economy tools
   • Real-time collaboration
   • 6-dimension ontology

✅ Generated custom ontology:
   • Groups: Organizations, teams
   • People: Developers, creators
   • Things: Projects, content, code
   • Connections: Collaborations, integrations
   • Events: Deployments, commits, releases
   • Knowledge: Documentation, patterns

[Write] Creating /one-platform/knowledge/ontology.md
[Write] Creating /one-platform/knowledge/brand-guide.md
[Write] Creating .env.local

📁 Installation folder created: /one-platform/

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**How it works:**
1. CLI runs `claude` to start Claude Code
2. CLI sends `/one analyze <url>` slash command
3. Claude Code invokes **agent-onboard**
4. agent-onboard uses WebFetch, Write, Edit tools
5. Results saved to installation folder
6. Control returns to CLI for feature selection

### Step 3: Custom Ontology Confirmation

```bash
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 YOUR CUSTOM ONTOLOGY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Based on https://one.ie, I've created a custom ontology:

GROUPS (Who organizes):
  • organizations, teams, projects

PEOPLE (Who acts):
  • platform_owner, org_owner, developer, creator

THINGS (What exists):
  • projects, websites, agents, content, features
  • deployments, repositories, integrations

CONNECTIONS (How they relate):
  • owns, collaborates_on, deployed_to, integrated_with

EVENTS (What happens):
  • project_created, feature_deployed, agent_executed
  • content_published, integration_connected

KNOWLEDGE (What's learned):
  • documentation, patterns, best_practices, lessons

? Does this match your vision? (y/n) › y

```typescript
const AGENT_MAPPING = {
  // Backend features
  "authentication": "agent-backend",
  "multi-tenant-groups": "agent-backend",
  "data-schema": "agent-backend",

  // Frontend features
  "landing-page": "agent-frontend",
  "dashboard": "agent-frontend",
  "user-profile": "agent-frontend",

  // Design features
  "wireframes": "agent-designer",
  "component-library": "agent-designer",
  "brand-guide": "agent-designer",

  // Integration features
  "stripe-payments": "agent-integrator",
  "discord-community": "agent-integrator",
  "email-marketing": "agent-integrator",

  // AI features
  "rag-knowledge": "agent-backend", // Convex vector search
  "semantic-search": "agent-backend",
  "ai-agents": "agent-builder",
};
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create agent-onboard

```typescript
// .claude/agents/agent-onboard.md
# Agent: Onboard

**Purpose:** Analyze existing website and generate custom ontology

**Responsibilities:**
1. Fetch and analyze website URL
2. Extract brand colors, logo, fonts
3. Detect existing features and tools
4. Identify target audience and tone
5. Generate custom 6-dimension ontology
6. Create installation folder structure
7. Populate initial documentation

**Tools:** WebFetch, Read, Write, Edit

**Output:**
- `/[installation-name]/knowledge/ontology.md`
- `/[installation-name]/groups/[group-name]/`
- `.env.local` with configuration
```

### 2. Update agent-director

```typescript
// Add to agent-director responsibilities:
- Coordinate with agent-onboard for initial setup
- Map user feature selections to cycle ranges
- Generate 100-cycle plan based on selections
- Assign features to appropriate specialists
- Track progress and notify user
```

### 3. Create CLI commands

```bash
# cli/bin/oneie.js
#!/usr/bin/env node

import { Command } from 'commander';
import { init, build, deploy } from '../src/commands/index.js';

const program = new Command();

program
  .name('oneie')
  .description('ONE Platform CLI - Make Your Ideas Real')
  .version('1.0.0');

program
  .command('init')
  .description('Initialize new ONE platform')
  .action(init);

program
  .command('build')
  .description('Build features using 100-cycle plan')
  .option('-f, --features <features...>', 'Features to build')
  .action(build);

program
  .command('deploy')
  .description('Deploy to production')
  .action(deploy);

program.parse();
```

### 4. Feature Library

```typescript
// cli/src/features/library.ts
export const FEATURES = {
  "landing-page": {
    name: "Landing Page",
    description: "Beautiful landing page with hero, features, CTA",
    cycles: [1, 10],
    duration: "~5 min",
    cost: "$0",
    requires: [],
    specialist: "agent-frontend",
  },
  "authentication": {
    name: "Authentication",
    description: "Email/password + OAuth (6 methods)",
    cycles: [11, 20],
    duration: "~10 min",
    cost: "$0",
    requires: ["landing-page"],
    specialist: "agent-backend",
  },
  "multi-tenant": {
    name: "Multi-Tenant Groups",
    description: "Hierarchical groups with data scoping",
    cycles: [21, 30],
    duration: "~10 min",
    cost: "$0",
    requires: ["authentication"],
    specialist: "agent-backend",
  },
  // ... more features
};
```
