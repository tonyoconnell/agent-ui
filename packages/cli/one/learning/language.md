# ONE Platform - Plain English DSL

**For:** Creators, CEOs, Non-technical Founders, AI Agents  
**Purpose:** Describe features in plain English that compiles to working code

---

## Core Concept

Write what you want in plain English. The system builds it.

**Example:**
```
FEATURE: Let fans chat with my AI clone

WHEN a fan sends a message
CHECK they own tokens
GET my AI personality 
SEND message to AI with my personality
SAVE the conversation
GIVE fan 10 tokens as reward
SHOW AI response to fan
```

**That's it.** The system builds the entire feature from this.

---

## The Language

### 1. FEATURE Declaration

Start every feature with what it does:

```
FEATURE: [Simple description of what this does]
```

**Examples:**
```
FEATURE: Create my AI voice clone
FEATURE: Let fans buy tokens
FEATURE: Enroll students in my course
FEATURE: Generate daily Instagram posts
```

### 2. INPUT - What You Need

List what information you need:

```
INPUT:
  - [name]: [what it is]
```

**Examples:**
```
INPUT:
  - creator: which creator this is for
  - video links: list of my videos
  - email: fan's email address
  - token amount: how many tokens to buy
```

### 3. OUTPUT - What You Get Back

List what you get when it's done:

```
OUTPUT:
  - [name]: [what it is]
```

**Examples:**
```
OUTPUT:
  - clone ID: my AI clone
  - voice ID: my cloned voice
  - payment ID: the transaction
  - success: whether it worked
```

### 4. The Flow - Step by Step

Write each step in order using these commands:

#### CHECK - Validate Something

```
CHECK [condition]
  OTHERWISE [what happens if it fails]
```

**Examples:**
```
CHECK creator exists
  OTHERWISE say "Creator not found"

CHECK fan has tokens
  OTHERWISE say "Buy tokens to chat"

CHECK video links are at least 3
  OTHERWISE say "Need 3+ videos for voice clone"
```

#### CREATE - Make Something New

```
CREATE [type] called [name]
  WITH [properties]
```

**Examples:**
```
CREATE ai clone called "John's AI Clone"
  WITH voice ID from previous step
  WITH personality prompt
  WITH active status

CREATE token called "CREATOR"
  WITH total supply of 10 million
  WITH symbol "CRTR"

CREATE course called "Learn AI"
  WITH 12 modules
  WITH price $99
```

#### CONNECT - Link Two Things

```
CONNECT [thing 1] to [thing 2] as [relationship]
```

**Examples:**
```
CONNECT creator to ai clone as owner

CONNECT fan to token as holder

CONNECT student to course as enrolled
```

#### RECORD - Log That Something Happened

```
RECORD [what happened]
  BY [who did it]
  WITH [extra details]
```

**Examples:**
```
RECORD clone created
  BY creator
  WITH voice ID and personality

RECORD tokens purchased
  BY fan
  WITH amount and price

RECORD lesson completed
  BY student
  WITH quiz score 95%
```

#### CALL - Use External Service

```
CALL [service] to [action]
  WITH [parameters]
  SAVE AS [name]
```

**Examples:**
```
CALL ElevenLabs to clone voice
  WITH audio samples from videos
  SAVE AS voice ID

CALL OpenAI to analyze personality
  WITH video transcripts

```

#### GET - Retrieve Something

```
GET [what] WHERE [conditions]
  SAVE AS [name]
```

**Examples:**
```
GET fan's token balance WHERE token is CREATOR
  SAVE AS balance

GET all content WHERE creator owns it
  SAVE AS my content

GET followers WHERE they follow creator
  SAVE AS follower list
```

#### IF - Conditional Logic

```
IF [condition]
  THEN [steps]
  ELSE [other steps]
```

**Examples:**
```
IF balance is greater than 0
  THEN allow chat
  ELSE say "Buy tokens first"

IF payment succeeded
  THEN mint tokens
  ELSE refund payment
```

#### DO TOGETHER - Atomic Operations

```
DO TOGETHER:
  - [step 1]
  - [step 2]
  - [step 3]
  
IF ANY FAIL:
  - [rollback step 1]
  - [rollback step 2]
```

**Examples:**
```
DO TOGETHER:
  - CALL Stripe to charge $100
  - CALL Blockchain to mint 1000 tokens
  - RECORD purchase in database
  
IF ANY FAIL:
  - CALL Stripe to refund
  - CALL Blockchain to burn tokens
  - DELETE purchase record
```

#### WAIT - Pause Execution

## Advanced Patterns

### Pattern: Error Handling

```
TRY:
  [steps that might fail]

IF IT FAILS:
  [what to do instead]

ALWAYS DO:
  [cleanup steps]
```

**Example:**
```
TRY:
  CALL payment processor
  CALL blockchain
  
IF IT FAILS:
  CALL refund payment
  SEND error notification
  
ALWAYS DO:
  RECORD what happened
  SAVE logs
```

### Pattern: Parallel Operations

```
DO AT SAME TIME:
  - [operation 1]
  - [operation 2]
  - [operation 3]

WAIT FOR ALL TO FINISH
```

**Example:**
```
DO AT SAME TIME:
  - CALL OpenAI to analyze videos
  - CALL OpenAI to analyze posts
  - CALL OpenAI to analyze comments

WAIT FOR ALL TO FINISH

COMBINE all results
```

### Pattern: Retry with Backoff

```
TRY UP TO 3 TIMES:
  [operation]

WAIT 5 seconds BETWEEN TRIES

IF ALL FAIL:
  [fallback]
```

**Example:**
```
TRY UP TO 3 TIMES:
  CALL voice cloning service

WAIT 5 seconds BETWEEN TRIES

IF ALL FAIL:
  USE default voice
  NOTIFY creator about failure
```

### Pattern: Queue and Process Later

```
ADD TO QUEUE:
  [task details]

PROCESS WHEN:
  [condition]
```

**Example:**
```
ADD TO QUEUE:
  Generate 30 days of content

PROCESS WHEN:
  System is not busy
  
NOTIFY creator when done
```

## Translation Table

**Plain English → Technical DSL (Hybrid Approach)**

| Plain English | Technical DSL | Type Category |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| CREATE ai clone | `{ entity: { type: "ai_clone" } }` | Specific Entity |
| CONNECT creator to clone as owner | `{ connect: { type: "owns" } }` | Specific Connection |
| RECORD clone created | `{ event: { type: "clone_created" } }` | Specific Event |
| RECORD payment completed | `{ event: { type: "payment_event", metadata: { status: "processed" } } }` | Consolidated Event |
| CONNECT via payment | `{ connect: { type: "transacted", metadata: { transactionType: "purchase" } } }` | Consolidated Connection |
| CALL ElevenLabs to clone voice | `{ service: { provider: "elevenlabs", method: "cloneVoice" } }` | Service |
| CHECK creator exists | `{ validate: { creatorId: { exists: true } } }` | Validation |
| GET fan's balance | `{ query: { from: "connections", where: [...] } }` | Query |
| IF balance > 0 | `{ if: { condition: "$balance > 0" } }` | Conditional |
| WAIT 24 hours | `{ wait: "24h" }` | Control Flow |
| DO TOGETHER | `{ atomic: [...] }` | Atomic Operation |
| FOR EACH video | `{ forEach: { array: "$videos" } }` | Loop |

---

## How It Works

**1. Creator writes in Plain English:**
```
FEATURE: Let fans buy my tokens

CHECK fan has valid payment
CALL Stripe to charge $100
CALL Blockchain to mint tokens
RECORD the purchase
GIVE confirmation
```

**2. System validates:**
- Are all entity types valid? (fan, tokens)
- Are all connection types valid? (owns, holds)
- Are all services available? (Stripe, Blockchain)

**3. System compiles to Technical DSL:**
```typescript
{
  feature: "PurchaseTokens",
  flow: [
    { validate: { ... } },
    { service: { provider: "stripe", ... } },
    { service: { provider: "blockchain", ... } },
    { event: { type: "tokens_purchased", ... } },
    { return: { ... } }
  ]
}
```

**4. System generates TypeScript:**
```typescript
export const purchaseTokens = (userId, tokenId, amount) =>
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // Fully typed, production-ready code
  });
```

**5. Tests auto-generated:**
```typescript
describe("purchaseTokens", () => {
  it("should purchase tokens successfully", async () => {
    // Complete test suite
  });
});
```

**6. Feature deployed:**
- Frontend components created
- Backend functions created
- Database schema updated
- Tests passing
- Ready for users

---

## Why This Works

**For Creators:**
- Write what you want in plain English
- No coding required
- Can read and understand every feature
- Can modify features yourself

**For AI Agents:**
- Unambiguous instructions
- Maps directly to technical DSL
- Validates against ontology
- Generates perfect code every time

**For Developers:**
- Readable specifications
- Generated code is clean and tested
- Can enhance generated code if needed
- System maintains consistency
