## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

**GroupsDemo Component Features:**

1. **State Management**
   - Groups list state with React useState
   - Form data state for group creation
   - Loading/syncing states for UX feedback
   - Status messages for user feedback
   - Expanded groups set for tree navigation

2. **Event Handlers**
   - `handleCreateGroup` - Submits form and creates group
   - `handleDeleteGroup` - Deletes group with confirmation
   - `toggleExpanded` - Expands/collapses tree nodes
   - Form field change handlers

3. **Hierarchical Tree Rendering**
   - `renderGroupTree()` recursive function
   - Supports infinite nesting depth
   - Visual indentation based on nesting level
   - Expand/collapse chevron icons
   - Group type icons (emoji based)

4. **Styling**
   - Tailwind v4 CSS classes
   - Dark mode support with `dark:` prefixes
   - Color-coded groups by type
   - Responsive grid layout
   - Smooth transitions and hover states

5. **UI Components Used**
   - shadcn/ui Button
   - shadcn/ui Skeleton (for loading)
   - DemoPlayground (shared demo wrapper)
   - lucide-react icons

### Integration with DemoLayout

```astro
<DemoLayout
  title="Groups: Multi-Tenant Isolation"
  description="Hierarchical containers for collaboration and data isolation"
  dimension="organizations"
>
  <!-- Content slots here -->
</DemoLayout>
```

Benefits:
- Consistent demo page styling
- Automatic sidebar navigation
- Breadcrumb support
- Connection status bar (from DemoConnectionStatus)
- Footer with learning resources

### Data Flow

```
1. Page Load (SSR in groups.astro)
   ↓
   Fetch groups from https://veracious-marlin-319.convex.cloud/http/groups
   ↓
   Pass initial groups to GroupsDemo component

2. Client Rendering
   ↓
   GroupsDemo renders with client:load (interactive)
   ↓
   User can create/delete groups

3. Create Group
   ↓
   Form submission → POST /http/groups
   ↓
   Response processed → State updated
   ↓
   UI re-renders with new group in tree

4. Delete Group
   ↓
   Confirmation dialog → DELETE /http/groups/:id
   ↓
   Response processed → State updated
   ↓
   UI re-renders with group removed from tree
```

### Error Handling

1. **Backend Connection Errors**
   - Graceful fallback with yellow warning box
   - Shows error message if available
   - Page remains functional in standalone mode

2. **API Errors**
   - Caught in try-catch blocks
   - Error messages displayed to user
   - Status messages with error variant (red)
   - Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds

3. **Validation**
   - Required fields enforced in HTML5
   - Parent group selector prevents invalid references
   - Delete confirmation prevents accidents

## User Experience Features

```typescript
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "@/convex/_generated/api";

export function GroupDashboard({ groupId }) {
  const group = useQuery(api.groups.get, { id: groupId });
  // ... component logic
}
```

   - If connection succeeds, GroupsDemo renders
   - If connection fails, warning message displays

2. **Create Group Test**
   - Fill form with valid data
   - Submit form
   - New group should appear in tree
   - Success message should display

3. **Hierarchical Test**
   - Create group A
   - Create group B with group A as parent
   - Group B should appear indented under group A
   - Click chevron to expand/collapse

4. **Delete Test**
   - Click delete button on group
   - Confirm in dialog
   - Group should be removed from tree
   - Success message should display

5. **Dark Mode Test**
   - Toggle dark mode
   - All colors should update correctly
   - Form inputs remain visible
   - Tree display readable

6. **Responsive Test**
   - Test on mobile (< 768px)
   - Layout should stack properly
   - Form and tree should remain usable
   - No horizontal scroll
