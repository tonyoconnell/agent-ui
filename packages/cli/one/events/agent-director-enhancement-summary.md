# Agent Director Enhancement Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Version:** 2.0.0
**Enhancement:** 100-Cycle Plan Generation from Feature Selections

---

## What Was Added

The agent-director has been enhanced with complete 100-cycle plan generation capabilities, transforming it from a simple workflow orchestrator into an intelligent plan generator and execution coordinator.

### 1. Feature Library (20+ Features)

A comprehensive library mapping every feature to specific cycle ranges:

**Foundation Features (Required):**
- `landing-page` (Cycle 1-10) - agent-frontend - ~5 min
- `authentication` (Cycle 11-20) - existing - ~0 min
- `multi-tenant-groups` (Cycle 21-30) - agent-backend - ~10 min

**Content & Creator Features:**
- `content-publishing` (Cycle 31-40) - agent-frontend - ~15 min
- `membership-tiers` (Cycle 41-50) - agent-backend - ~15 min
- `revenue-tracking` (Cycle 51-60) - agent-backend - ~10 min

**Developer Features:**
- `project-management` (Cycle 31-40) - agent-builder - ~15 min
- `code-repositories` (Cycle 41-50) - agent-integrator - ~15 min
- `deployment-pipeline` (Cycle 51-60) - agent-ops - ~20 min

**AI Features:**
- `ai-agents` (Cycle 61-70) - agent-builder - ~20 min
- `rag-knowledge` (Cycle 71-80) - agent-backend - ~15 min
- `semantic-search` (Cycle 81-90) - agent-backend - ~10 min

**Integration Features:**
- `stripe-payments` (Cycle 31-40) - agent-integrator - ~15 min
- `email-marketing` (Cycle 41-50) - agent-integrator - ~10 min
- `discord-community` (Cycle 51-60) - agent-integrator - ~15 min

**Design & UX Features:**
- `design-system` (Cycle 71-80) - agent-designer - ~15 min
- `wireframes` (Cycle 71-75) - agent-designer - ~10 min

**Performance & Analytics Features:**
- `performance-monitoring` (Cycle 81-90) - agent-ops - ~10 min
- `analytics-dashboard` (Cycle 81-90) - agent-frontend - ~15 min

Each feature includes:
- Cycle range (where it fits in 1-100)
- Specialist agent assignment
- Duration estimate
- Cost estimate
- Dependencies
- Complete ontology mapping (things, connections, events, knowledge)

### 2. Plan Generation Algorithm

A 6-step algorithm for converting feature selections into executable plans:

**Step 1: Read Feature Selections**
- From `.onboarding.json` or user input
- Includes organization name, website URL, custom ontology

**Step 2: Resolve Dependencies**
- Automatically includes required dependencies
- Prevents breaking changes from missing dependencies
- Example: Selecting "ai-agents" automatically includes "landing-page", "authentication", "multi-tenant-groups"

**Step 3: Map to Cycle Ranges**
- Creates phases with specific cycle ranges
- Assigns specialist agents
- Maps to ontology dimensions

**Step 4: Calculate Estimates**
- Total duration (minutes + hours)
- Total cost (sum of all features)
- Total cycle count (out of 100)

**Step 5: Generate Execution Plan**
- Complete ExecutionPlan structure
- Phase definitions with metadata
- Progress tracking structure

**Step 6: Write to .onboarding.json**
- Saves complete plan as JSON
- Creates human-readable markdown summary (.onboarding-plan.md)

### 3. Execution Coordination

Event-driven workflow coordination across all specialist agents:

**Phase Execution Pattern:**
1. Emit `phase_started` event
2. Delegate to specialist agent
3. Monitor progress via events
4. Update `.onboarding.json` progress
5. Emit `phase_complete` event

**Progress Tracking:**
- Real-time updates to `.onboarding.json`
- Completion percentage calculation
- Current cycle tracking
- Phase status tracking

**Sequential vs Parallel Execution:**
- Automatic detection of parallelizable phases
- No shared dependencies = parallel execution
- Different specialists = optimization opportunity

**Error Handling & Recovery:**
- Retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- Delegate to problem-solver on final failure
- Manual intervention support
- Error logging to `.onboarding.json`

**Real-Time Status Display:**
- Progress percentage
- Current phase and cycle
- Phase list with status icons
- Estimates (duration, cost)

### 4. Data Structures

**ExecutionPlan Interface:**
```typescript
interface ExecutionPlan {
  version: string;
  organizationName: string;
  createdAt: number;
  plan: {
    phases: Phase[];
    totalCycles: number;
    currentCycle: number;
    completedCycles: number[];
    estimates: {
      duration: string;
      cost: string;
      cycles: number;
    };
  };
  progress: {
    status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed";
    startedAt?: number;
    completedAt?: number;
    currentPhase?: string;
  };
}
```

**Phase Interface:**
```typescript
interface Phase {
  name: string;
  featureKey: string;
  cycles: { start: number; end: number };
  specialist: string;
  duration: string;
  cost: string;
  status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "failed";
  ontology: {
    things?: string[];
    connections?: string[];
    events?: string[];
    knowledge?: string[];
  };
}
```

## How It Works

### Example: User Selects 5 Features

**Input:**
```json
{
  "selectedFeatures": [
    "landing-page",
    "authentication",
    "multi-tenant-groups",
    "project-management",
    "ai-agents"
  ],
  "organizationName": "Acme Corp",
  "websiteUrl": "https://acme.com"
}
```

**Process:**
1. **Resolve Dependencies**: All dependencies automatically included (none needed in this case)
2. **Map to Cycles**:
   - landing-page → Cycle 1-10
   - authentication → Cycle 11-20 (existing, skip)
   - multi-tenant-groups → Cycle 21-30
   - project-management → Cycle 31-40
   - ai-agents → Cycle 61-70
   - deployment → Cycle 91-100 (always included)
3. **Calculate Estimates**:
   - Total: 50 cycles (out of 100)
   - Duration: ~60 minutes (~1 hour)
   - Cost: $0
4. **Generate Plan**: Complete ExecutionPlan with 6 phases
5. **Write to `.onboarding.json`**: JSON + markdown summary

**Output:**
```

## Integration with Onboarding Workflow

The enhanced agent-director integrates seamlessly with the existing onboarding workflow:

1. **CLI runs** `npx oneie init`
2. **User provides** organization name, website URL
3. **agent-onboard** analyzes website, creates custom ontology
4. **User selects** features from CLI menu
5. **agent-director** generates 100-cycle plan
6. **agent-director** coordinates execution across specialists
7. **Real-time progress** shown in terminal
8. **Each phase completes** → Live deployment
9. **Final result** → Fully functional platform

---
