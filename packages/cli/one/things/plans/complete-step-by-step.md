## 🤖 AGENT-DIRECTOR ORCHESTRATION MODEL

**WHO DOES THE WORK:**

This plan is executed by the agent network, coordinated by **agent-director**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

**HOW IT WORKS:**

1. **agent-director** reads this plan and validates it against ontology
2. For **Phase 1 (Backend):**
   - agent-director emits `feature_assigned` event for backend tasks
   - **agent-backend** begins implementation
   - **agent-quality** simultaneously defines tests (no blocking dependency)
   - agent-backend and agent-quality work in parallel
   - When implementation done: agent-quality validates
   - If tests fail: agent-problem-solver investigates
   - If tests pass: agent-documenter writes docs
   - agent-director marks phase complete

3. For **Phase 4 (Features):**
   - agent-director breaks feature into sub-tasks (backend, frontend, integration)
   - **agent-backend**, **agent-frontend**, **agent-integrator** work in parallel
   - Each specialist emits `implementation_complete` when done
   - **agent-quality** runs tests for each component
   - **agent-designer** creates UI specs driven by test requirements
   - All specialists implement to pass tests
   - agent-director waits for all to complete

4. **Failure Recovery:**
   - If any specialist fails: emit `test_failed` event
   - **agent-problem-solver** analyzes failure
   - Problem solver proposes fix with `solution_proposed` event
   - Original specialist implements fix
   - Quality re-validates
   - Pipeline continues

## ⚡ PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY

**THE GOAL:** 5x faster delivery by eliminating sequential wait times

**CURRENT BOTTLENECKS (Sequential):**

```
Phase 1: Backend implementation (10-12 hrs)
   → Wait for backend done
   → Phase 1 QA: Testing (3 hrs)
   → Wait for tests pass
   → Phase 2: Frontend implementation (8-10 hrs)
Total Sequential: 21-25 hours ❌
```

**NEW APPROACH (Parallel):**

```
Phase 1a: Backend coding + Phase 1b: Test definition (simultaneous)
   10-12 hrs (backend)  \
                         → Parallel execution
    3 hrs (test def)    /

Phase 1c: Implementation validation (3 hrs)
   Test backend against defined criteria

Phase 2a: Frontend coding + Phase 2b: Integration spec (simultaneous)
    8-10 hrs (frontend)  \
                          → Parallel execution
    2 hrs (integration)  /

Result: ~18 hours total (vs. 25 sequential) = 28% time savings ✅
```

**WHICH PHASES CAN RUN IN PARALLEL:**

✅ **Can Parallelize (Independent):**

- Backend CRUD + Test definition (tests don't depend on implementation)
- Backend code + Frontend code (different codebases)
- Documentation + Quality checks (separate concerns)

❌ **Must Wait (Dependencies):**

- Backend implementation MUST complete before integration tests
- Schema design MUST complete before tests are written (defines what to test)
- Quality approval MUST complete before documenter finalizes

**PARALLEL PHASE EXECUTION PLAN:**

## 🎯 AGENT SKILL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

To execute this plan optimally, update agents as follows:

### agent-director

**Current:** Validates ideas, creates plans, assigns features
**Needed:**

- Add `parallelExecutionOrchestration()` method to manage concurrent phases
- Add `dependencyResolution()` to identify which tasks can run in parallel
- Add `blockageDetection()` to identify stuck tasks waiting for dependencies
- Add `eventMonitoring()` to watch for `implementation_complete` from all agents
- Add `progressTracking()` to display real-time parallel execution status
- Enhance `featureAssignment()` to batch-assign multiple features to multiple agents simultaneously

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// In agent-director prompts:
"You manage parallel execution across 5-8 agents simultaneously.
When assigning Phase 1 tasks:
1. Assign backend code to agent-backend
2. SIMULTANEOUSLY assign test definition to agent-quality
3. Monitor BOTH for completion events
4. Wait for both to complete before validation
5. Track overall progress as: Parallel(backend_code, test_def) → validation
6. Display progress: 'Backend: 8/10 hrs | Quality: 2/3 hrs | ETA: 2h'"
```

### agent-backend

**Current:** Implements mutations, queries, schema, Effect.ts
**Needed:**

- Add `parallelCRUDImplementation()` to parallelize Groups/Things/Connections implementation
- Add `dependencyTracker()` to know which services are ready for Effect.ts wrapping
- Add `testReadiness()` to emit `schema_ready` event when schema complete (so quality can start)
- Add `progressEmission()` to emit hourly updates of which services are complete
- Add `blockageHandling()` to detect when waiting on quality feedback

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// In agent-backend prompts:
"Emit events to keep agent-quality informed:
- When schema complete: emit 'schema_ready' event
- Every hour: emit 'progress_update' with completed_services: ['groups', 'things', ...]
- When mutation done: emit 'mutation_complete' with mutation_name
- If stuck: emit 'blocked_waiting_for' with blocker_name"
```

### agent-frontend

**Current:** Implements components, pages, styling, performance
**Needed:**

- Add `waitForSchemaEvent()` to not start until backend emits `schema_ready`
- Add `parallelComponentDevelopment()` to code multiple pages simultaneously
- Add `designSystemAlignment()` to wait for agent-designer's component specs
- Add `progressTracking()` to emit component completion events
- Add `performanceBudgeting()` to measure Core Web Vitals during development

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// In agent-frontend prompts:
"Watch for these events to proceed:
- 'schema_ready' → Begin component development (can't start before)
- 'test_definitions_complete' → Understand test requirements
- 'wireframes_complete' → Have design guidance
- After each component done: emit 'component_complete' event"
```

### agent-quality

**Current:** Defines tests, validates implementations, generates insights
**Needed:**

- Add `parallelTestDefinition()` to define tests for multiple dimensions (Groups, Things, Connections, Events, Knowledge) simultaneously
- Add `schemaAwarenessWaiting()` to emit `ready_to_define` when schema structure known
- Add `continuousValidation()` to validate components as they complete (not waiting for all)
- Add `parallelTestExecution()` to run unit, integration, e2e tests concurrently
- Add `blockageRecovery()` to handle test failures by emitting `test_failed` for problem-solver

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// In agent-quality prompts:
"Enable parallel test development:
- Watch for 'schema_ready' event from agent-backend
- THEN define tests for Groups, Things, Connections, Events, Knowledge in parallel
- For each, emit 'tests_ready_for_X' event
- As backend components complete, emit 'validation_passed_for_X'
- If tests fail: emit 'test_failed' with detailed failure reason
- Agent-problem-solver monitors test_failed events"
```

### agent-designer

**Current:** Creates wireframes, component specs, design tokens
**Needed:**

- Add `testDrivenDesign()` to use agent-quality's test requirements to guide design
- Add `parallelComponentDesign()` to design multiple components simultaneously
- Add `accessibilityFirstDesign()` to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA from start (not retrofit)
- Add `readyStateTracking()` to emit `design_spec_complete_for_X` for each component
- Add `performanceConsiderations()` to design for Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s)

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// In agent-designer prompts:
"Design components driven by test requirements:
- Read test user flows from agent-quality
- For each component: emit 'design_spec_complete_for_X'
- Ensure all designs meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Consider image sizes, lazy loading, critical CSS for performance
- Provide design tokens that agent-frontend can directly implement"
```

### agent-ops

**Current:** Handles deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, releases
**Needed:**

- Add `deploymentPipelineSetup()` to prepare staging/production pipelines early
- Add `releaseAutomation()` to automate version bumping, changelog generation
- Add `productionReadiness()` to validate all quality gates before production deploy
- Add `postDeploymentMonitoring()` to track metrics after each release
- Add `incidentResponse()` to handle failures in production quickly

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// In agent-ops prompts:
"Prepare deployment infrastructure early:
- During Phase 1: Set up staging environment
- During Phase 2: Test deployment pipeline with dummy app
- During Phase 3: Run full system test on staging
- Before Phase 4: Validate all quality gates
- Each release: Run sanity checks on production
- Monitor: Lighthouse scores, API latency, error rates, user retention"
```

### agent-documenter

**Current:** Writes documentation, updates knowledge base
**Needed:**

- Add `parallelDocumentation()` to write different docs simultaneously (API, integration, architecture)
- Add `knowledgeBaseUpdates()` to automatically extract lessons learned from test results
- Add `semanticSearchOptimization()` to use knowledge embeddings for discovery
- Add `useCaseDocumentation()` to document real customer workflows
- Add `lessonsCapture()` to automatically capture and store insights

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// In agent-documenter prompts:
"Document each completed phase:
- As agent-backend completes: Write API docs + schema docs
- As agent-frontend completes: Write component usage guide
- As agent-quality runs tests: Capture test patterns as lessons learned
- Store in /one/knowledge/ with appropriate labels for semantic search
- Generate README sections from architecture insights"
```

### agent-problem-solver

**Current:** Analyzes failures, proposes solutions
**Needed:**

- Add `continuousMonitoring()` to watch `test_failed` events from all agents
- Add `rootCauseAnalysisAutomation()` to automatically categorize failures
- Add `solutionProposalSpeed()` to propose fixes within 10 minutes of failure
- Add `fixVerification()` to re-run tests after fix to confirm resolution
- Add `failurePatternDetection()` to identify recurring issues early

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// In agent-problem-solver prompts:
"Monitor all test_failed events continuously:
- When received: Immediately analyze root cause
- Categorize: Ontology violation | Logic error | Performance | Accessibility
- Propose fix with specific code changes
- Emit 'solution_proposed' event with fix details
- Original specialist implements fix
- You re-run tests to verify
- If pass: Emit 'fix_complete' + capture lesson learned"
```

```

### Why This Architecture:

**Convex Components handle:**

- Agent thread management & streaming
- Vector search for RAG
- Rate limiting (per-user, per-org)
- Durable workflows with retries
- Long-running task queues
- Real-time persistent streaming

**Effect.ts wraps them for:**

- Type-safe error handling
- Service composition
- Dependency injection
- Testability
- Business logic orchestration

### Step 1.1: Implement Groups Queries & Mutations

**Time:** 2 hours
**Deliverable:** Full CRUD for groups

```typescript
// backend/convex/queries/groups.ts - Complete this

export const get = query({
  args: { id: v.id("groups") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db.get(args.id);
  },
});

export const list = query({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db.query("groups").collect();
  },
});

// backend/convex/mutations/groups.ts - Complete this

export const create = mutation({
  args: {
    name: v.string(),
    type: v.union(
      v.literal("friend_circle"),
      v.literal("business"),
      v.literal("organization"),
      // ... other group types
    ),
    parentGroupId: v.optional(v.id("groups")),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Create group with all properties
    const id = await ctx.db.insert("groups", {
      name: args.name,
      type: args.type,
      parentGroupId: args.parentGroupId,
      status: "active",
      createdAt: Date.now(),
      updatedAt: Date.now(),
    });
    // Log creation event
    await ctx.db.insert("events", {
      groupId: id,
      type: "group_created",
      actorId: ctx.auth?.getUserIdentity()?.tokenIdentifier,
      targetId: id,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    });
    return id;
  },
});
```

**Check:**

- [ ] Query returns correct group
- [ ] Mutation creates with all fields
- [ ] Events logged
- [ ] Tests pass

---

### Step 1.2: Implement Things Queries & Mutations

**Time:** 2 hours
**Deliverable:** Full CRUD for things with filtering and pagination (Ontology Dimension 3)

```typescript
// backend/convex/queries/things.ts - Complete this

export const list = query({
  args: {
    groupId: v.id("groups"),
    type: v.optional(v.string()),
    status: v.optional(v.string()),
    limit: v.optional(v.number()),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    let query = ctx.db
      .query("entities")
      .withIndex("group_type", (q) => q.eq("groupId", args.groupId));

    if (args.type)
      query = query.filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("type"), args.type));
    if (args.status)
      query = query.filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("status"), args.status));

    return await query.take(args.limit ?? 100).collect();
  },
});

export const get = query({
  args: { id: v.id("entities") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db.get(args.id);
  },
});
```

### Step 1.3: Implement Connections Queries & Mutations

**Time:** 1.5 hours
**Deliverable:** Query and create relationships

```typescript
// backend/convex/queries/connections.ts - Complete this

export const list = query({
  args: { groupId: v.id("groups") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db
      .query("connections")
      .withIndex("by_group", (q) => q.eq("groupId", args.groupId))
      .collect();
  },
});

export const fromEntity = query({
  args: { entityId: v.id("entities") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db
      .query("connections")
      .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("fromEntityId"), args.entityId))
      .collect();
  },
});
```

    return await ctx.db
      .query("events")
      .withIndex("by_group", (q) => q.eq("groupId", args.groupId))
      .order("desc") // Most recent first
      .collect();
  },
});

export const byActor = query({
  args: { actorId: v.id("entities") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db
      .query("events")
      .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("actorId"), args.actorId))
      .order("desc")
      .collect();
  },
});
```

      .query("knowledge")
      .withIndex("by_group", (q) => q.eq("groupId", args.groupId))
      .collect();
  },
});

export const search = query({
  args: {
    groupId: v.id("groups"),
    query: v.string(),
    limit: v.optional(v.number()),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // For now, basic text search
    // Later: vector similarity search
    const all = await ctx.db
      .query("knowledge")
      .withIndex("by_group", (q) => q.eq("groupId", args.groupId))
      .collect();

    const filtered = all.filter((k) =>
      k.text?.toLowerCase().includes(args.query.toLowerCase()),
    );

    return filtered.slice(0, args.limit ?? 10);
  },
});
```

**Check:**

- [ ] List works
- [ ] Search returns results
- [ ] Limit works

**Time:** 2 hours
**Deliverable:** Effect.ts services wrapping Convex for composition

```typescript
// backend/convex/services/layers.ts

import { Effect, Context, Layer, Data } from "effect";
import { Agent } from "@convex-dev/agent";
import { RAG } from "@convex-dev/rag";

// Error definitions
class AgentError extends Data.TaggedError("AgentError")<{
  cause: unknown;
}> {}

class RAGError extends Data.TaggedError("RAGError")<{
  cause: unknown;
}> {}

// Service definitions
class AgentService extends Context.Tag("AgentService")<
  AgentService,
  {
    readonly createThread: (
      userId: string,
    ) => Effect.Effect<string, AgentError>;
    readonly generateResponse: (
      threadId: string,
      prompt: string,
    ) => Effect.Effect<string, AgentError>;
  }
>() {}

class RAGService extends Context.Tag("RAGService")<
  RAGService,
  {
    readonly addDocument: (
      namespace: string,
      text: string,
      metadata: any,
    ) => Effect.Effect<string, RAGError>;
    readonly search: (
      namespace: string,
      query: string,
      limit: number,
    ) => Effect.Effect<SearchResult[], RAGError>;
  }
>() {}

// Implementations
const AgentServiceLive = Layer.effect(
  AgentService,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    // Agent component initialized
    const agent = new Agent(components.agent, {
      name: "ONE Assistant",
      chat: openai.chat("gpt-4o-mini"),
      instructions: "You are a helpful assistant for the ONE Platform.",
    });

    return {
      createThread: (userId) =>
        Effect.tryPromise({
          try: async () => {
            const { threadId } = await agent.createThread(ctx, { userId });
            return threadId;
          },
          catch: (error) => new AgentError({ cause: error }),
        }),

      generateResponse: (threadId, prompt) =>
        Effect.tryPromise({
          try: async () => {
            const { thread } = await agent.continueThread(ctx, { threadId });
            const { text } = await thread.generateText({ prompt });
            return text;
          },
          catch: (error) => new AgentError({ cause: error }),
        }),
    };
  }),
);

const RAGServiceLive = Layer.effect(
  RAGService,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const rag = new RAG(components.rag, {
      textEmbeddingModel: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
      embeddingDimension: 1536,
    });

    return {
      addDocument: (namespace, text, metadata) =>
        Effect.tryPromise({
          try: () =>
            rag.add(ctx, {
              namespace,
              text,
              filterValues: Object.entries(metadata).map(([k, v]) => ({
                name: k,
                value: v,
              })),
            }),
          catch: (error) => new RAGError({ cause: error }),
        }),

      search: (namespace, query, limit) =>
        Effect.tryPromise({
          try: () =>
            rag.search(ctx, {
              namespace,
              query,
              limit,
              vectorScoreThreshold: 0.6,
            }),
          catch: (error) => new RAGError({ cause: error }),
        }),
    };
  }),
);

// Export combined layer
export const AllServicesLive = Layer.merge(AgentServiceLive, RAGServiceLive);
```

}
```

## 🔗 PHASE 2: HONO HTTP LAYER + INTEGRATION (Week 2-3)

**Status:** Optional but valuable for external API access
**Time:** 3-4 hours
**Deliverable:** External API layer with API key auth

### Option A: Just Connect Frontend to Convex (FAST - 2 hours)

If you just want frontend + backend talking:

```typescript
// The frontend hooks already call the backend perfectly
// Just ensure:
✅ web/.env.local has CONVEX_URL
✅ backend/.env.local has CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT
✅ Both are the same backend deployment
✅ Frontend runs at localhost:4321
✅ Backend at localhost:3210

// Then test end-to-end:
1. Start backend: cd backend && npx convex dev
2. Start frontend: cd web && bun run dev
3. Visit http://localhost:4321/signup
4. Sign up → check convex dashboard for user created
5. Visit dashboard → fetch data from backend
```

**This works TODAY because:**

- ✅ Frontend hooks use DataProvider (backend-agnostic)
- ✅ Better Auth is fully configured
- ✅ All Convex queries/mutations exist (or will after Phase 1)
- ✅ No Hono layer needed unless you want REST API

---

### Option B: Add Hono REST API (BETTER - 4 hours)

If you want external API access (mobile apps, third-party integrations, etc.):

```typescript
// backend/convex/http.ts - Create Hono HTTP layer

import { Hono } from "hono";
import { cors } from "hono/cors";
import { handle } from "hono/vercel";
import { httpRouter } from "convex/server";

const app = new Hono();

// Middleware
app.use("*", cors());

// Health check
app.get("/api/health", (c) => {
  return c.json({ status: "ok", timestamp: Date.now() });
});

// Route to Convex queries
app.get("/api/groups/:id", async (c) => {
  const id = c.req.param("id");
  // Call Convex mutation/query
  // Return response
});

app.post("/api/things", async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.json();
  // Call Convex mutation
  // Return created ID
});

// ... More routes

export default httpRouter({
  "/": handle(app),
});
```

**This lets you:**

- ✅ Call ONE from mobile apps (API key auth)
- ✅ Build third-party integrations
- ✅ Use Zapier/Make integrations
- ✅ Expose REST API to partners

**Decision:** Skip Hono for now. Connect frontend→backend directly. Add Hono in Phase 4 if needed.

---

## ✅ PHASE 3: FULL SYSTEM TEST (Week 3)

**Status:** After Phase 1 & 2, test the entire stack end-to-end

### Test Checklist (2-3 hours)

```bash
# 1. Start both servers
cd backend && npx convex dev &  # Terminal 1
cd web && bun run dev            # Terminal 2

# 2. Test signup flow
- Visit http://localhost:4321/signup
- Sign up with test email
- Check Convex dashboard for user creation
- Should see Better Auth user created

# 3. Test authentication

## 📊 COMPLETE TIMELINE

```
This Week (3 days):        Quick Wins (polish foundation)
Week 1-2 (10 hours):       Complete backend stubs + Phase 1
Week 2-3 (4 hours):        Connect frontend to backend (Phase 2)
Week 3 (3 hours):          Full system test (Phase 3)
Week 4 onwards (2-3 wks):  Build features one at a time

TOTAL TO PRODUCTION: 4-5 weeks with solid foundation
```

---

## 🎓 Key Principles

1. **Don't rebuild - build on what exists**
   - Frontend is complete
   - Schema is complete
   - Auth is complete
   - Just fill in the backend stubs

2. **One feature at a time**
   - Complete feature fully before next
   - Each feature tests the whole stack
   - Quick wins = fast feedback

3. **Test end-to-end**
   - Frontend → Backend → Database → Frontend
   - Real user flows, not just unit tests
   - Proves integration works

4. **Deploy early, often**
   - Staging after each feature
   - Production after testing
   - Learn from real usage

5. **Follow the patterns**
   - Every feature: Things → Connections → Events → Knowledge
   - Every mutation: create, update, delete with logging
   - Every component: loading, error, success states
