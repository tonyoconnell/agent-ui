# Feature 1-2: YAML-Driven Orchestrator

**Assigned to:** Backend Specialist Agent (agent-backend.md)
**Status:** ⚠️ SIMPLIFIED - Claude Code IS the orchestrator
**Plan:** 1-create-workflow
**Priority:** Low (documentation-only)
**Dependencies:** 1-1 (Agent Prompts System)

---

## Simplified Approach: Claude Code IS the Orchestrator

**Key Insight:** We don't need to build an orchestrator. Claude Code already orchestrates by reading instructions and using tools.

### Why No Code Needed

1. **Claude Code can read agent prompts**
   - Uses Read tool to load `one/things/agents/agent-*.md`
   - Understands role, responsibilities, decision framework
   - Follows instructions naturally

2. **Claude Code can route work**
   - Reads workflow guide (this document)
   - Determines which agent to "become" for each task
   - Switches context by reading appropriate agent prompt

3. **Claude Code can execute stages**
   - Validates ideas (reads director prompt)
   - Creates plans (reads director prompt)
   - Writes features (reads specialist prompts)
   - Defines tests (reads quality prompt)
   - Creates designs (reads designer prompt)
   - Implements code (reads specialist prompts)

4. **Claude Code can log events**
   - Uses Write tool to create event files
   - Follows naming conventions from Feature 1-6
   - Creates markdown records naturally

**What we actually need:** A workflow guide (this document) that tells Claude Code which agent prompt to read at each stage.

---

## Feature Specification

### What We're Documenting

A workflow guide that helps Claude Code orchestrate the 6-level agent-based workflow by reading agent prompts and following their instructions. No orchestrator code - just clear documentation of which agent does what, when.

**Philosophy:** Claude Code > Custom Code. Why build an orchestrator when Claude Code can read instructions?

---

## Ontology Types

## The 6-Stage Workflow Guide

This guide tells Claude Code which agent prompt to read at each stage and what to do.

### How Claude Code Uses This Guide

**When user provides an idea:**

1. Read this guide to understand workflow stages
2. For each stage, read the appropriate agent prompt
3. Follow that agent's instructions
4. Move to next stage when complete

**No orchestrator code needed** - Claude Code reads and follows instructions naturally.

---

## Stage-by-Stage Instructions

### Stage 1: Ideas (Validation)

**What to do:**

1. Read `one/things/agents/agent-director.md`
2. Follow Director agent's "Validate Idea" instructions
3. Check if idea maps to ontology types (organizations, people, things, connections, events, knowledge)
4. Decide: Is this a single feature or a plan (multiple features)?

**Input:** User's raw idea text

**Output:**

- Valid → Move to Stage 2 (Plans)
- Invalid → Explain why, suggest ontology alignment

**File to create:** `one/things/ideas/{N}-{idea-name}.md` (optional)

---

### Stage 2: Plans (Feature Breakdown)

**What to do:**

1. Read `one/things/agents/agent-director.md`
2. Follow Director agent's "Create Plan" instructions
3. Break validated idea into features
4. Assign each feature to specialist (backend/frontend/integration)
5. Use numbering conventions from Feature 1-6

**Input:** Validated idea

**Output:** Plan file with feature list + assignments

**File to create:** `one/things/plans/{N}-{plan-name}.md`

---

### Stage 3: Features (Specification)

**What to do:**

1. For each feature in plan, read appropriate specialist prompt:
   - Backend features → Read `one/things/agents/agent-backend.md`
   - Frontend features → Read `one/things/agents/agent-frontend.md`
   - Integration features → Read `one/things/agents/agent-integration.md`
2. Follow specialist's "Write Feature Spec" instructions
3. Map feature to ontology types
4. Reference patterns from `one/knowledge/patterns/`
5. Use numbering conventions: `{N}-{M}-{feature-name}.md`

**Input:** Feature assignment from plan

**Output:** Feature specification (Level 3)

**Files to create:** `one/things/features/{N}-{M}-{feature-name}.md` (one per feature)

**Note:** Can be done in parallel for multiple features

---

### Stage 4: Tests (Quality Criteria)

**What to do:**

1. Read `one/things/agents/agent-quality.md`
2. Follow Quality agent's "Define Tests" instructions
3. Define three levels:
   - **User flows:** What users accomplish
   - **Acceptance criteria:** How we know it works
   - **Technical tests:** Unit/integration/e2e
4. Start from user perspective first

**Input:** Feature specification

**Output:** Test criteria

**File to create:** `one/things/features/{N}-{M}-{feature-name}/tests.md`

**Note:** Can be done in parallel for multiple features

---

### Stage 5: Design (Wireframes)

**What to do:**

1. Read `one/things/agents/agent-designer.md`
2. Follow Designer agent's "Create Design" instructions
3. Design to make tests pass (test-driven design)
4. Create:
   - Wireframes (visual structure)
   - Component architecture
   - Design tokens (colors, spacing, timing)
5. Every design decision references a test criterion

**Input:** Feature spec + test criteria

**Output:** Design specification

**File to create:** `one/things/features/{N}-{M}-{feature-name}/design.md`

**Note:** Can be done in parallel for multiple features

---

### Stage 6: Implementation (Code)

**What to do:**

1. Read appropriate specialist prompt (backend/frontend/integration)
2. Follow specialist's "Implement Feature" instructions
3. Write code according to design spec
4. Run tests (read quality agent for validation approach)
5. If tests fail:
   - Read `one/things/agents/agent-problem-solver.md`
   - Follow problem solver's "Analyze & Fix" instructions
   - Implement fix, retest
6. When tests pass:
   - Read `one/things/agents/agent-documenter.md`
   - Follow documenter's "Write Docs" instructions

**Input:** Feature spec + tests + design

**Output:** Working implementation + documentation + lessons learned

**Files to create:**

- Implementation code (varies by feature)
- `one/things/features/{N}-{M}-{feature-name}/lessons.md` (if problems solved)
- Documentation (varies by feature)

**Note:** Sequential per feature (implement → test → fix → document), but multiple features can be done in parallel

## Files to Create

**None.** This is a workflow guide document, not an implementation.

Claude Code uses this guide by:

1. Reading this document when user provides an idea
2. Following stage-by-stage instructions
3. Reading agent prompts as directed
4. Creating files using tools (Write, Edit, etc.)

**Optional:** Simple reference card for quick lookup

```markdown
# one/workflows/quick-reference.md

Stage 1: Read agent-director.md → Validate idea
Stage 2: Read agent-director.md → Create plan
Stage 3: Read agent-{specialist}.md → Write specs
Stage 4: Read agent-quality.md → Define tests
Stage 5: Read agent-designer.md → Create design
Stage 6: Read agent-{specialist}.md → Implement code
```

## Error Handling (AI-Native)

### Missing Agent Prompts

- Claude checks if agent file exists before reading
- If missing: Clear error to user with expected path
- Example: "Agent prompt not found: one/things/agents/agent-backend.md"

### Invalid User Input

- Claude reads director prompt for validation rules
- Explains why idea doesn't map to ontology
- Suggests how to align idea with ontology types

### Test Failures

- Claude reads problem-solver prompt
- Follows "Analyze & Fix" instructions
- Implements fix, retests automatically

### Claude Code Tool Errors

- File write fails → Retry with corrected path
- Read fails → Check file exists, provide helpful message
- Directory doesn't exist → Create automatically

**Key insight:** Claude Code handles errors intelligently by reading appropriate agent prompts and following their instructions.

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Advantages of AI-Native Approach

- **No code to load/execute** - Just reading markdown files
- **No context switching** - Claude Code maintains context across stages
- **Parallel processing** - Can handle multiple features simultaneously
- **Smart error recovery** - Understands context, doesn't blindly retry

### Expected Workflow Times

- **Documentation reading:** Instant (files already in context)
- **Stage execution:** Depends on LLM speed + file I/O
- **Full workflow:** Variable (complexity-dependent)

**Target: Faster than manual process** - No context switching between tools, agents, or documents.

---

## Testing Strategy (AI-Native)

### Manual Verification

- Give Claude Code a simple idea
- Verify it follows all 6 stages correctly
- Check files created in correct locations
- Confirm agent prompts referenced appropriately

### Agent Validation

- Each agent prompt contains examples
- Claude Code follows examples when uncertain
- Problem solver provides self-correction

### No Unit Tests Needed

- No code to test
- Claude Code's natural language understanding is the "test"
- Verification happens through usage

---

**Key insights:**

1. **Claude Code IS the orchestrator** - No need to build what already exists
2. **Reading > Executing** - Claude reads agent prompts and follows instructions naturally
3. **0 lines of code** - 150+ lines of TypeScript replaced with markdown workflow guide
4. **AI-native architecture** - Leverages LLM's natural ability to understand and follow instructions
5. **Simpler = Better** - Documentation beats code for AI-driven workflows

**How it works:**

```
User: "Build a course platform"
Claude: Reads this guide → Reads agent-director.md → Validates idea →
        Creates plan → Reads agent-backend.md → Writes feature specs →
        Reads agent-quality.md → Defines tests → ... → Complete
```

**No orchestrator code runs. Just Claude following documented instructions.** 🎯
