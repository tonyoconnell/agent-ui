# The Nine Padel Playbook: Your Business, In Plain English

Welcome to the new way of running your store. Forget needing a developer for every small change. This document is your playbook. It teaches you a simple English-based language to write "Plays"—automated strategies that your store will run for you.

Think of it like writing a recipe. You list the steps, and your intelligent store engine follows them perfectly, every time.

**The Core Concept:** Your entire business—every product, customer, and order—is organized into a simple, six-part structure called an ontology. Every command you write is checked against this structure, guaranteeing it will work as expected.

### Your Command Reference: The Building Blocks of Your Plays

These are the simple English commands you'll use to write your business strategies.

#### **CREATE** - Add Something New

Use this to add a new product, a guide, or a discount to your store.

- `CREATE product called "Head Radical MP" WITH price £180 AND FOR intermediate players.`
    
- `CREATE guide called "How to Prevent Padel Elbow" WITH content from our expert.`
    
- `CREATE discount code "SUMMER10" FOR 10% off all bags.`
    

#### **GET** - Find Information

Use this to find customers, products, or orders that match specific criteria.

- `GET all customers WHO BOUGHT a Nox racket.`
    
- `GET all orders WITH a total value OVER £200.`
    
- `GET the 5 most viewed products THIS MONTH.`
    

#### **CONNECT** - Link Two Things Together

Use this to create relationships, like assigning a review to a product.

- `CONNECT a new review TO the "Bullpadel Vertex" racket.`
    
- `CONNECT the "Beginner's Guide" TO all rackets FOR beginners.`
    

#### **RECORD** - Log That Something Happened

Use this to create a permanent record of an important action for your analytics.

- `RECORD a customer service chat WITH a positive outcome.`
    
- `RECORD that a customer visited our physical pop-up store.`
    

#### **CHECK** - Make a Decision

Use this to create rules and logic in your Plays.

- `CHECK a customer's total spending is OVER £500.`
    
- `CHECK the stock for the "Adidas Metalbone" is LESS THAN 10.`
    
- `CHECK IF a customer is in the "Loyalists" group.`
    

#### **NOTIFY** - Send a Message

Use this to communicate with customers or your staff.

- `NOTIFY the customer VIA email ABOUT their shipped order.`
    
- `NOTIFY the warehouse staff VIA Slack ABOUT a new high-value order.`
    

#### **WAIT** - Pause for the Perfect Moment

Use this to time your actions perfectly.

- `WAIT 24 hours after a cart is abandoned.`
    
- `WAIT until a customer has been inactive FOR 30 days.`

### How It All Works: From Your Words to a Live Feature

You don't need to worry about the technical details, but here’s the simple process that happens in seconds when you write a Play:

1. **You Write in English:** You write a feature using the commands above.
    
2. **System Validates:** The system checks your Play against the six-part ontology to make sure it makes sense (e.g., you can't `CONNECT` a `product` to another `product` as `places`).
    
3. **System Builds:** It automatically generates the necessary code and database logic.
    
4. **Feature is Live:** Your new automated strategy is deployed and running on the edge, close to your customers, making your store smarter.
    

This isn't just a tool; it's your new business partner, ready to execute your best strategies, 24/7.
