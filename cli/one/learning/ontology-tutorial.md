## Part 1: Understanding Ontology Composition

### The Core Ontology

Every ONE installation starts with the **core ontology** defined in `/one/knowledge/ontology-core.yaml`.

The core ontology provides the foundation:

```yaml
feature: core
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Foundation ontology with 6 dimensions"

thingTypes:
  - name: creator
    description: "Human creator with role and permissions"

  - name: ai_clone
    description: "Digital twin with voice + appearance"

  - name: group
    description: "Multi-tenant container with hierarchical nesting"

connectionTypes:
  - name: owns
    description: "Ownership relationship"
    fromType: any
    toType: any

  - name: member_of
    description: "Group membership with role metadata"
    fromType: creator
    toType: group

eventTypes:
  - name: thing_created
    description: "Any entity created"
    thingType: any

  - name: thing_updated
    description: "Any entity updated"
    thingType: any
```

**Key Concepts:**

- **6 Dimensions:** groups, people, things, connections, events, knowledge
- **Core Types:** Foundation types that all features build upon
- **Composability:** Features extend core without breaking changes

### Feature Ontologies

Features extend the core with specialized types. Here's a simplified example:

```yaml
feature: blog
extends: core
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Blogging platform feature"

thingTypes:
  - name: blog_post
    description: "Written blog content"
    properties:
      title: string
      content: string
      slug: string
      publishedAt: number

  - name: blog_category
    description: "Blog post category"
    properties:
      name: string
      slug: string

connectionTypes:
  - name: categorized_as
    description: "Post belongs to category"
    fromType: blog_post
    toType: blog_category

  - name: authored
    description: "Creator authored post"
    fromType: creator # From core ontology
    toType: blog_post # From this feature

eventTypes:
  - name: post_published
    description: "Blog post published"
    thingType: blog_post

  - name: post_viewed
    description: "Someone viewed post"
    thingType: blog_post
```

**How Features Compose:**

1. **Extends Core:** `extends: core` means you get all core types
2. **References Core Types:** You can use `creator` from core in your connections
3. **Adds Feature Types:** New types only exist when feature is enabled
4. **Type Safety:** TypeScript types are auto-generated

## Part 2: Creating Your First Feature

Let's create a **newsletter** feature step-by-step.

### Step 1: Plan Your Data Model

Before writing YAML, answer these questions:

**What entities do we need?** (Things)

- `newsletter` - The newsletter publication
- `newsletter_issue` - Individual issues/editions
- `subscriber` - Someone subscribed to newsletter
- `newsletter_campaign` - Email campaign sending issues

**How do they relate?** (Connections)

- `creator` → `newsletter` (owns)
- `newsletter` → `newsletter_issue` (part_of)
- `subscriber` → `newsletter` (subscribed_to)
- `newsletter_campaign` → `newsletter_issue` (sends)

**What actions happen?** (Events)

- `newsletter_created` - New newsletter created
- `newsletter_subscribed` - Someone subscribed
- `newsletter_unsubscribed` - Someone unsubscribed
- `issue_published` - New issue published
- `issue_sent` - Issue sent to subscribers

### Step 2: Create the YAML File

Create `/one/knowledge/ontology-newsletter.yaml`:

```yaml
# Newsletter Feature Ontology
# Provides newsletter publications, subscriptions, and campaigns

feature: newsletter
extends: core
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Newsletter platform with subscriptions and campaigns"

# ============================================================================
# Thing Types - What exists
# ============================================================================

      status: string # draft, scheduled, sending, sent

# ============================================================================
# Connection Types - How things relate
# ============================================================================

  # Creator owns newsletter
  - name: owns_newsletter
    description: "Creator owns newsletter publication"
    fromType: creator # From core ontology

```

### Step 3: Generate Types

Run the type generator to create TypeScript types:

```bash
# Generate types with newsletter feature enabled
PUBLIC_FEATURES="newsletter" bun run backend/scripts/generate-ontology-types.ts

# Or enable multiple features
PUBLIC_FEATURES="blog,newsletter,shop" bun run backend/scripts/generate-ontology-types.ts
```

**Output:**

```
