# Design for Feature 1-1: Agent Prompts System

**Feature:** 1-1-agent-prompts
**Status:** Design → Implementation
**Design Agent:** agent-designer.md

---

## Design Goal

Enable `/one` CLI command to seamlessly leverage 12 agent prompts for autonomous workflow execution. Design is focused on how Claude Code naturally reads and applies agent prompts without complex UI.

---

## CLI Context

**Command:** `/one [action]`

**Examples:**

```bash
/one idea "Build a course platform"           # Director validates idea
/one plan 1                                    # Director creates plan 1
/one feature 1-1                               # Specialist writes feature spec
/one test 1-1                                  # Quality defines tests
/one design 1-1                                # Designer creates wireframes
/one implement 1-1                             # Specialist implements
/one fix 1-1                                   # Problem solver analyzes
/one docs 1-1                                  # Documenter writes docs
```

## Design Decisions (Test-Driven)

### Decision 1: No Visual UI - Prompt-Driven Interaction

**Test requirement:** Claude must load correct agent prompt based on command
**Design solution:**

- Command maps to agent role
- Claude reads agent prompt file
- Claude follows prompt instructions
- Output is natural conversation + file creation

**Reasoning:** CLI is text-based. Best UX is clear, helpful responses that guide user through workflow.

---

### Decision 2: Agent Context Visible to User

**Test requirement:** User understands which agent is "speaking"
**Design solution:**

```
Claude Code (as Engineering Director):
> I've validated your idea against the ontology...
> Creating plan 2-course-platform with 4 features...

Claude Code (as Backend Specialist):
> Writing feature spec for 2-1-course-crud...
> Mapping to ontology types: course (thing), owns (connection)...

Claude Code (as Quality Agent):
> Defining tests for 2-1-course-crud...
> User flow 1: Create a course in < 10 seconds...
```

**Reasoning:** User knows what's happening and can follow workflow progression.

---

### Decision 3: Prompt Loading is Invisible

**Test requirement:** Agent prompt loads < 100ms, user doesn't wait
**Design solution:**

- Claude uses Read tool to load prompt
- Happens instantly (prompts are small markdown files)
- User sees result, not loading

**Example:**

```
User: /one idea "course platform"

Claude: [Reads agent-director.md]
        [Follows "Validate Idea" instructions]
        [Responds naturally]

✅ Idea validated! Mapped to ontology:
   - Things: course, lesson, creator, student
   - Connections: owns, part_of, enrolled_in
   - Events: course_created, lesson_completed
   - Complexity: Medium (2-3 weeks, 4 features)

Would you like me to create a plan? [Y/n]
```

---

### Decision 4: Context Budget Implicit

**Test requirement:** Claude stays within context budgets (director: 200, specialist: 1500, etc.)
**Design solution:**

- Context budgets documented in agent prompts
- Claude loads only what's needed
- User doesn't see token counts (technical detail)

**Reasoning:** Token budgets are implementation detail. User experiences fast, relevant responses.

---

### Decision 5: Multi-Agent Coordination Transparent

**Test requirement:** Multiple agents coordinate without user intervention
**Design solution:**

```
User: /one implement 1-1

Claude Code (as Backend Specialist):
> Implementing feature 1-1-agent-prompts...
> [Writes code, runs tests]
> Tests failed: Event logging missing

Claude Code (switching to Problem Solver):
> Analyzing failure with ultrathink mode...
> Root cause: Forgot to log agent_prompt_created event
> Proposing fix...

Claude Code (back to Backend Specialist):
> Implementing fix...
> Tests passing ✅
> Capturing lesson learned...

Done! Feature 1-1 complete.
```

**Reasoning:** User sees agents working together, understands what's happening, doesn't need to manually coordinate.

---

## Component Architecture

### 1. Command Router (Claude's Understanding)

```typescript
// Conceptual - Claude understands this pattern naturally
/one idea      → Read agent-director.md → Follow "Validate Idea" section
/one plan      → Read agent-director.md → Follow "Create Plan" section
/one feature   → Read agent-{specialist}.md → Follow "Write Feature Spec"
/one test      → Read agent-quality.md → Follow "Define Tests"
/one design    → Read agent-designer.md → Follow "Create Design"
/one implement → Read agent-{specialist}.md → Follow "Implement Feature"
/one fix       → Read agent-problem-solver.md → Follow "Analyze & Fix"
/one docs      → Read agent-documenter.md → Follow "Write Documentation"
```

**No code needed** - Claude maps commands to agent prompts naturally.

---

### 2. Agent Prompt Structure (Already Defined)

```markdown
# [Agent Role] Agent

## Role

[One sentence]

## Responsibilities

- [List]

## Input / Output

- [Specifications]

## Decision Framework

- [How to make decisions]

## Key Behaviors

- [Critical behaviors]

## Communication Patterns

- [Events to watch/emit]

## Examples

- [Concrete examples]
```

**Design Note:** This structure makes prompts scannable for both Claude and humans.

---

### 3. Response Patterns

**Validation Response:**

```
✅ [Success indicator]
[What was validated]
[Ontology mapping]
[Next steps]

[Optional: Ask for confirmation]
```

**Work In Progress:**

```
🔄 [Agent role]
[Current task]
[Progress indicator]
[What's happening]
```

**Completion Response:**

```
✅ [What completed]
[Key results]
[Files created]
[What to do next]
```

**Error Response:**

```
❌ [What failed]
[Why it failed]
[How to fix]
[Retry suggestion]
```

---

## Wireframes (CLI Outputs)

## Implementation Notes

**No UI to build** - Just ensure agent prompts are:

1. Well-structured (already done ✅)
2. Easy for Claude to scan
3. Include clear examples
4. Specify decision frameworks

**CLI responses** handled by Claude naturally:

- Reads prompt
- Follows instructions
- Responds conversationally
- Creates files as needed

---

## Next Steps

Ready for Level 6 (Implementation):

- Agent prompts already created ✅ (12 files, 303KB)
- Design validates approach
- CLI flow natural and clear
- Implementation is using the prompts

---

**Status:** ✅ Design Complete

**Key Design Insights:**

1. **No UI needed** - CLI is text-based, agents respond conversationally
2. **Role indicators** - User always knows which agent is "speaking"
3. **Invisible complexity** - Context loading, prompt parsing happen instantly
4. **Multi-agent coordination** - Clear role switches, seamless collaboration
5. **Test-driven design** - Every design decision enables test criteria

**The design is the prompts themselves + Claude's natural conversation ability.** 🎯
