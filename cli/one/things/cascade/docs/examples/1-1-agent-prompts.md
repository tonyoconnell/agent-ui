# Feature 1-1: Agent Prompts System

**Assigned to:** Backend Specialist Agent (agent-backend.md)
**Status:** ✅ Complete (12 agent files implemented)
**Plan:** 1-create-workflow
**Priority:** Critical
**Dependencies:** None
**Implementation:** `/one/things/agents/` (12 files, 303KB total)

---

## Feature Specification

### What We're Building

A complete prompt system for 6 agent roles that enables autonomous collaboration in the workflow. Each prompt defines behavior, responsibilities, context requirements, and decision-making frameworks.

**Not the "how"** - This spec defines what the prompts need to accomplish, not the implementation details.

---

## Ontology Types

### Things

- `agent` - Engineering units with specific roles
  - Properties: `role`, `responsibilities`, `contextTokens`, `inputTypes`, `outputTypes`
  - Validates: type structure is in ontology

### Connections

- `coordinates_with` - How agents interact
  - Metadata: `eventTypes[]`, `communicationPattern`

### Events

- `agent_prompt_created` - New agent prompt defined
  - Metadata: `role`, `responsibilities`, `contextTokens`
- `agent_prompt_validated` - Prompt tested and approved
  - Metadata: `testResults`, `approvedBy`

---

## The 6 Agent Roles

### 1. Engineering Director Agent

**Core responsibility:** Validates ideas, creates plans, assigns features, marks complete

**Input:**

- User ideas (raw text)
- Feature status updates (from events)
- Quality reports (from quality agent)

**Output:**

- Validated ideas → plans
- Plans with feature assignments
- Task lists for parallel execution
- Feature completion events

**Context budget:** 200 tokens (ontology type names only)

**Decision framework:**

- Is idea mappable to ontology types? → Valid or Invalid
- Should idea be plan or single feature? → Plan if 3+ features
- Which specialist for which feature? → Based on category (backend/frontend/integration)

**Key behaviors:**

- Always validate against ontology first
- Break plans into parallel-executable features
- Assign based on specialist expertise
- Review and refine when quality flags issues
- Update completion events

---

### 2. Specialist Agents (Backend, Frontend, Integration)

**Core responsibility:** Write features, execute tasks, fix problems

**Types:**

- **Backend Specialist** - Services, mutations, queries, schemas
- **Frontend Specialist** - Pages, components, UI/UX
- **Integration Specialist** - Connections between systems, data flows

**Input:**

- Feature assignments (from director)
- Solution proposals (from problem solver)
- Design specifications (from design agent)

**Output:**

- Feature specifications (Level 3)
- Working implementations (Level 6)
- Fixed code (after problem solving)
- Lessons learned entries

**Context budget:** 1,500 tokens (types + patterns)

**Decision framework:**

- What ontology types does this feature use?
- What patterns apply? (from knowledge/patterns/)
- What tests must pass? (from quality agent)
- Does design satisfy test criteria?

**Key behaviors:**

- Write feature specs before implementation
- Reference patterns from knowledge base
- Implement exactly to design specifications
- Fix problems when tests fail
- Add lessons learned after fixes

---

### 3. Quality Agent

**Core responsibility:** Define tests, validate implementations, ensure ontology alignment

**Input:**

- Feature specifications (from specialists)
- Completed implementations (from specialists)

**Output:**

- User flows (what users must accomplish)
- Acceptance criteria (how we know it works)
- Technical tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- Quality reports (pass/fail with details)

**Context budget:** 2,000 tokens (ontology + feature + UX patterns)

**Decision framework:**

- Does feature align with ontology structure?
- What user flows must work?
- What acceptance criteria validate the flows?
- What technical tests validate the implementation?

**Key behaviors:**

- Define user flows FIRST (user perspective)
- Then acceptance criteria (specific, measurable)
- Then technical tests (implementation validation)
- Keep tests as simple as possible
- Validate implementations against all three

---

### 4. Design Agent

**Core responsibility:** Create wireframes and component architecture that enable tests to pass

**Philosophy:** Design exists to make tests pass (test-driven design)

**Input:**

- Feature specifications (from specialists)
- Test criteria (user flows + acceptance criteria from quality)

**Output:**

- Wireframes (visual structure)
- Component architecture (hierarchy and relationships)
- Design tokens (colors, timing, spacing)
- Design decisions (why each choice was made)

**Context budget:** 2,000 tokens (feature + tests + design patterns)

**Decision framework:**

- Which test criteria drive design decisions?
- What component structure satisfies user flows?
- What design tokens ensure acceptance criteria met?
- Is design accessible and performant?

**Key behaviors:**

- Start from test requirements
- Every design decision references a test criterion
- Create wireframes that show user flows
- Define component architecture
- Set design tokens that meet performance requirements
- Ensure accessibility standards met

---

### 5. Problem Solver Agent

**Core responsibility:** Analyze failed tests using ultrathink, propose solutions

**Mode:** Deep analysis (ultrathink)

**Input:**

- Failed test results (from quality agent)
- Implementation code (that failed)
- Ontology structure (for context)

**Output:**

- Root cause analysis (why it failed)
- Solution proposals (specific code changes)
- Delegation instructions (assign to specialist)

**Context budget:** 2,500 tokens (failed tests + implementation + ontology)

**Decision framework:**

- What is the root cause? (logic error, missing dependency, wrong pattern?)
- What pattern was missed? (check lessons learned)
- What is the minimum fix required?
- Which specialist should implement the fix?

**Key behaviors:**

- Use ultrathink mode for deep analysis
- Search lessons learned for similar issues
- Identify root cause before proposing solution
- Propose specific, minimal fixes
- Delegate to appropriate specialist
- Ensure lesson is captured after fix

---

### 6. Documenter Agent

**Core responsibility:** Write documentation after features complete

**Input:**

- Completed features (post-quality validation)
- Implementation details (from specialists)
- Test criteria (from quality)

**Output:**

- Feature documentation (what it does, how to use)
- API documentation (if applicable)
- User guides (if user-facing)
- Knowledge base updates

**Context budget:** 1,000 tokens (feature + tests + implementation)

**Decision framework:**

- What does user need to know?
- What are the key features and benefits?
- How do they use it?
- What are common issues and solutions?

**Key behaviors:**

- Write for the target audience (users, developers, or both)
- Include examples and code snippets
- Link to related features and resources
- Keep it concise and scannable
- Update knowledge base with new patterns
