# /smart-route - Intelligent Agent Selection Command

🧠 **AI-powered agent matching for optimal task execution**

_Automatically analyzes your task and routes to the most suitable agent based on skills, workload, and quality history_

## 🎯 How Intelligent Routing Works

### 1. **Task Analysis**

- Extracts key requirements and skill needs from your task description
- Identifies domain (marketing, engineering, content, research, sales, service)
- Determines complexity level and urgency
- Maps requirements to agent capabilities

### 2. **Agent Skill Matching**

- Cross-references task requirements with agent expertise profiles
- Calculates match scores based on specialization alignment
- Considers agent's core competencies and secondary skills
- Filters for agents with proven success in similar tasks

### 3. **Workload Awareness**

- Checks current agent workload and availability
- Routes to less busy agents when skills overlap significantly
- Provides estimated wait times for busy specialists
- Suggests backup agents with equivalent capabilities

### 4. **Quality History**

- Analyzes past performance on similar task types
- Prefers agents with 4.0+ star track record
- Considers success rate and completion times
- Weights recent performance higher than historical

## 🚀 Usage Patterns

## 🧠 Smart Routing Rules

### Skill Priority Matrix

1. **Exact Specialization Match** (100 points)
2. **Domain Expertise** (80 points)
3. **Secondary Skills** (60 points)
4. **Team Management** (40 points)
5. **General Capabilities** (20 points)

### Workload Balancing

- **Available** → Route immediately
- **Light Load** (1-2 tasks) → Route with note
- **Busy** (3+ tasks) → Suggest alternatives or wait time
- **Overloaded** (5+ tasks) → Auto-redirect to alternatives

### Quality Weighting

- **4.5+ stars** → +20% priority boost
- **4.0-4.4 stars** → Standard routing
- **3.5-3.9 stars** → Only if best available
- **<3.5 stars** → Avoid unless no alternatives

### Emergency Routing Logic

1. Find available agents with task expertise
2. If none available, select shortest wait time
3. If all busy >10min, escalate to team managers
4. For critical issues, interrupt current tasks if needed
