---

## Decision Framework

### For Data Migration

1. **What was this in the old system?** → Identify legacy model
2. **What thing type is this?** → Map to 1 of 66 thing types
3. **What are its relationships?** → Map to connection types
4. **What actions happened?** → Create historical events
5. **What knowledge does it contain?** → Extract for RAG
6. **Can it be batched?** → Optimize for performance
7. **What's the rollback plan?** → Ensure safety

### For Code Migration

1. **What does this component do?** → Understand behavior
2. **What data does it need?** → Map to Convex queries
3. **What pattern matches this?** → Reference transformation patterns
4. **Does it need interactivity?** → Add client:load if needed
5. **What shadcn components apply?** → Replace old UI elements
6. **Does it preserve functionality?** → Verify feature parity

### For AI Clone Creation

1. **Who is the creator?** → Get creator thing
2. **What content do they have?** → Query authored connections
3. **How much knowledge is needed?** → Determine chunk size
4. **What services will it power?** → Create powers connections
5. **Is voice/appearance available?** → Clone or use defaults
6. **What's the system prompt?** → Generate from creator profile

---

## Key Behaviors

### Migration Process

1. **Always start with discovery and inventory**
   - Document everything before touching anything
   - Create comprehensive inventories of source systems
   - Map legacy models to ontology before writing code

2. **Map to ontology systematically**
   - Use correct thing types (not generic "entity")
   - Preserve relationships as connections
   - Generate events for all actions
   - Extract knowledge for RAG

3. **Use batch processing with dry-run mode**
   - Process in batches (default: 100 items)
   - Always run dry-run first
   - Store ID mappings for troubleshooting
   - Report progress regularly

4. **Verify data integrity at every step**
   - Check thing counts match source
   - Verify all connections point to valid things
   - Validate event chronology
   - Ensure no orphaned records

5. **Transform code to new patterns**
   - React components → Convex hooks + shadcn/ui
   - API endpoints → Convex queries/mutations
   - Database queries → Ontology-aware queries
   - CSS → Tailwind v4 design tokens

6. **Document everything**
   - Migration reports with success/failure counts
   - Known issues and data quality notes
   - ID mappings for reconciliation
   - Verification results

### AI Clone Creation Process

1. **Extract knowledge from creator content**
   - Query all content with `authored` connections
   - Chunk text into 500-token segments with 50-token overlap
   - Generate embeddings using text-embedding-3-large
   - Store as knowledge type `chunk`

2. **Create AI clone thing with proper properties**

   ```typescript
   {
     type: "ai_clone",
     name: `${creator.name} AI`,
     properties: {
       voiceId: string | null,
       voiceProvider: "elevenlabs" | "azure" | "custom",
       appearanceId: string | null,
       appearanceProvider: "d-id" | "heygen" | "custom",
       systemPrompt: string,  // Generated from creator profile
       temperature: 0.7,
       knowledgeBaseSize: number,  // Chunk count
       lastTrainingDate: number,
       totalInteractions: 0,
       satisfactionScore: 0
     },
     status: "draft"  // "active" after voice/appearance cloned
   }
   ```

3. **Create connection network**
   - `clone_of`: Link AI clone to original creator
     - Metadata: cloneVersion, trainingDataSize
   - `trained_on`: Link AI clone to knowledge items
     - Metadata: chunkCount, trainingDate, weight
   - `powers`: Link AI clone to services it powers
     - Metadata: serviceType, enabledAt, config

4. **Use thingKnowledge junction for granular tracking**

   ```typescript
   {
     thingId: aiCloneId,
     knowledgeId: knowledgeChunkId,
     role: "chunk_of",
     metadata: {
       trainingPhase: "initial",
       addedAt: Date.now()
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Log all clone events**
   - `clone_created`: When AI clone thing created
   - `voice_cloned`: When voice successfully cloned
   - `appearance_cloned`: When appearance successfully cloned
   - `clone_updated`: When retraining occurs

6. **Generate system prompts from creator data**
   - Include creator's niche and expertise
   - Reference target audience
   - Incorporate bio and communication style
   - Set appropriate temperature and behavior guidelines

## Transformation Patterns

### Pattern 1: User → Creator Thing

**Legacy Model:**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  bio?: string;
  followers: number;
  following: string[];
  posts: string[];
}
```

**6-Dimension Ontology:**

```typescript
// 1. Thing (creator)
{
  type: "creator",
  name: user.name,
  properties: {
    email: user.email,
    username: deriveUsername(user.email),
    displayName: user.name,
    bio: user.bio || "",
    niche: [],
    expertise: [],
    targetAudience: "",
    totalFollowers: user.followers,
    totalContent: user.posts.length,
    totalRevenue: 0,
    role: "org_user"
  },
  status: "active"
}

// 2. Connections (following)
for (const followedId of user.following) {
  {
    fromThingId: newUserId,
    toThingId: followedUserId,
    relationshipType: "following"
  }
}

// 3. Connections (authored)
for (const postId of user.posts) {
  {
    fromThingId: newUserId,
    toThingId: newPostId,
    relationshipType: "authored"
  }
}

// 4. Event (historical)
{
  type: "user_registered",
  actorId: newUserId,
  targetId: newUserId,
  timestamp: user.createdAt,
  metadata: { source: "migration" }
}
```

### Pattern 2: API Endpoint → Convex Query

**Legacy Code:**

```typescript
// pages/api/users/[id].ts
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { id } = req.query;
  const user = await db.users.findUnique({ where: { id } });
  res.json(user);
}
```

**New Code:**

```typescript
// convex/queries/creators.ts
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const get = query({
  args: { id: v.id("things") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const creator = await ctx.db.get(args.id);

    if (!creator || creator.type !== "creator") {
      return null;
    }

    return creator;
  },
});
```

### Pattern 3: React Component Migration

**Legacy Component:**

```tsx
// src/components/UserProfile.tsx (React 18)
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`)
      .then((r) => r.json())
      .then(setUser);
  }, [userId]);

  if (!user) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div className="profile">
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>{user.bio}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**New Component:**

```tsx
// src/components/features/creators/CreatorProfile.tsx (React 19)
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "@/convex/_generated/api";
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Skeleton } from "@/components/ui/skeleton";
import type { Id } from "@/convex/_generated/dataModel";

export function CreatorProfile({ creatorId }: { creatorId: Id<"things"> }) {
  const creator = useQuery(api.queries.creators.get, { id: creatorId });

  if (creator === undefined) {
    return <Skeleton className="h-32 w-full" />;
  }

  if (creator === null) {
    return (
      <Card>
        <CardContent>Creator not found</CardContent>
      </Card>
    );
  }

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{creator.name}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <p>{creator.properties.bio}</p>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## AI Clone Creation Example

### Example: Create AI Clone from Migrated Creator

**Scenario:** Creator "Sarah Chen" has been migrated with 50 blog posts and 20 videos. Create an AI clone trained on her content.

**Input:**

```typescript
const creatorId = "k123abc456"; // Sarah Chen's thing ID
```

**Process:**

**Step 1: Query Creator's Content**

```typescript
const connections = await ctx.db
  .query("connections")
  .withIndex("from_type", (q) =>
    q.eq("fromThingId", creatorId).eq("relationshipType", "authored"),
  )
  .collect();

const content = await Promise.all(
  connections.map((conn) => ctx.db.get(conn.toThingId)),
);
// Returns: 70 content items (50 blog posts + 20 videos)
```

**Step 2: Extract and Chunk Text**

```typescript
const allText = content.map((item) => item.properties.body).join("\n\n");

const chunks = await chunkContent(allText, {
  maxTokens: 500,
  overlap: 50,
});
// Creates: 1,500 chunks
```

**Step 3: Generate Embeddings**

```typescript
const knowledgeIds = [];
for (const chunk of chunks) {
  const embedding = await generateEmbedding(chunk.text);

  const knowledgeId = await ctx.db.insert("knowledge", {
    knowledgeType: "chunk",
    text: chunk.text,
    embedding: embedding,
    embeddingModel: "text-embedding-3-large",
    embeddingDim: 1536,
    sourceThingId: content[0]._id,
    sourceField: "body",
    chunk: {
      index: chunk.index,
      start: chunk.start,
      end: chunk.end,
      tokenCount: chunk.tokenCount,
      overlap: 50,
    },
    labels: ["training_data", "topic:marketing", "skill:copywriting"],
    metadata: { createdFrom: "migration" },
    createdAt: Date.now(),
    updatedAt: Date.now(),
  });

  knowledgeIds.push(knowledgeId);
}
```

**Step 4: Create AI Clone Thing**

```typescript
const creator = await ctx.db.get(creatorId);

const aiCloneId = await ctx.db.insert("things", {
  type: "ai_clone",
  name: `${creator.name} AI`,
  properties: {
    voiceId: null,
    voiceProvider: "elevenlabs",
    appearanceId: null,
    appearanceProvider: "d-id",
    systemPrompt: `You are an AI clone of Sarah Chen, a marketing and copywriting expert.

Your expertise includes: SEO, content marketing, conversion optimization.

Your target audience is: Small business owners and solopreneurs.

Bio: ${creator.properties.bio}

Speak in her voice, share her knowledge, and help her audience as she would.`,
    temperature: 0.7,
    knowledgeBaseSize: 1500,
    lastTrainingDate: Date.now(),
    totalInteractions: 0,
    satisfactionScore: 0,
  },
  status: "draft",
  createdAt: Date.now(),
  updatedAt: Date.now(),
});
```

**Step 5: Create Connection Network**

```typescript
// Connection: clone_of (AI clone → Creator)
await ctx.db.insert("connections", {
  fromThingId: aiCloneId,
  toThingId: creatorId,
  relationshipType: "clone_of",
  metadata: {
    cloneVersion: "1.0",
    trainingDataSize: 1500,
  },
  createdAt: Date.now(),
});

// Connection: trained_on (AI clone → Knowledge)
// High-level tracking of knowledge sources
const knowledgeGroups = groupKnowledgeBySource(knowledgeIds);
for (const [sourceId, chunks] of knowledgeGroups) {
  await ctx.db.insert("connections", {
    fromThingId: aiCloneId,
    toThingId: sourceId, // Knowledge item ID
    relationshipType: "trained_on",
    metadata: {
      chunkCount: chunks.length,
      trainingDate: Date.now(),
      weight: 1.0,
    },
    createdAt: Date.now(),
  });
}

// Junction: thingKnowledge (Granular chunk links)
for (const knowledgeId of knowledgeIds) {
  await ctx.db.insert("thingKnowledge", {
    thingId: aiCloneId,
    knowledgeId: knowledgeId,
    role: "chunk_of",
    metadata: {
      trainingPhase: "initial",
      addedAt: Date.now(),
    },
    createdAt: Date.now(),
  });
}
```

**Step 6: Log Events**

```typescript
await ctx.db.insert("events", {
  type: "clone_created",
  actorId: creatorId,
  targetId: aiCloneId,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  metadata: {
    knowledgeChunks: 1500,
    contentSources: 70,
    version: "1.0",
  },
});
```

**Output:**

```markdown
✅ AI clone created: k789xyz012

- Name: Sarah Chen AI
- Knowledge chunks: 1,500
- Content sources: 70 (50 blog posts + 20 videos)
- Status: draft (pending voice/appearance cloning)
- Connections: 1 clone_of, 70 trained_on, 1,500 thingKnowledge links
```

## Verification Checklist

### Data Integrity Checks

```typescript
// scripts/migration/verify-migration.ts

async function verifyMigration() {
  console.log("🔍 Verifying migration...");

  const checks = [
    verifyThingCounts(),
    verifyConnectionIntegrity(),
    verifyEventChronology(),
    verifyKnowledgeLinks(),
  ];

  const results = await Promise.all(checks);

  results.forEach((result) => {
    console.log(result.passed ? "✅" : "❌", result.name);
    if (!result.passed) {
      console.log("  Errors:", result.errors);
    }
  });
}

async function verifyThingCounts() {
  const oldUserCount = await sourceDB.users.count();
  const newCreatorCount = await convex.query(api.queries.things.countByType, {
    type: "creator",
  });

  return {
    name: "Thing counts match",
    passed: oldUserCount === newCreatorCount,
    errors:
      oldUserCount !== newCreatorCount
        ? [`Expected ${oldUserCount}, got ${newCreatorCount}`]
        : [],
  };
}

async function verifyConnectionIntegrity() {

  const errors = [];
  for (const conn of connections) {
    const from = await convex.query(api.queries.things.get, {
      id: conn.fromThingId,
    });
    const to = await convex.query(api.queries.things.get, {
      id: conn.toThingId,
    });

    if (!from || !to) {
      errors.push(
        `Broken connection: ${conn._id} (${from ? "✓" : "✗"} → ${
          to ? "✓" : "✗"
        })`,
      );
    }
  }

  return {
    name: "Connection integrity",
    passed: errors.length === 0,
    errors,
  };
}

async function verifyEventChronology() {
  const events = await convex.query(api.queries.events.listAll);

  const errors = [];
  for (let i = 1; i < events.length; i++) {
    if (events[i].timestamp < events[i - 1].timestamp) {
      errors.push(
        `Event chronology broken: ${events[i]._id} before ${events[i - 1]._id}`,

  };
}

async function verifyKnowledgeLinks() {

  });

  const errors = [];
  for (const clone of clones) {
    const knowledgeLinks = await convex.query(

      { thingId: clone._id },
    );

    if (knowledgeLinks.length !== clone.properties.knowledgeBaseSize) {

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Migration Mistakes

1. **Migrating without inventory**
   - ❌ Start coding immediately
   - ✅ Document source system first, create comprehensive inventory

2. **Using wrong thing types**
   - ❌ Generic "entity" or "user" type
   - ✅ Use specific types: "creator", "audience_member", "ai_clone"

3. **Losing relationships**
   - ❌ Only migrate things, ignore connections
   - ✅ Create connections for all relationships, use proper connection types

4. **Skipping verification**
   - ❌ Assume migration succeeded
   - ✅ Run full verification suite, check counts and integrity

5. **No dry-run testing**
   - ❌ Run live migration first time
   - ✅ Always dry-run first, review output, fix errors

6. **Using "entities" terminology**
   - ❌ Refer to "entities" in code and docs
   - ✅ Use "things" throughout (matches ontology)

### AI Clone Mistakes

1. **Creating clone without knowledge**
   - ❌ Create ai_clone thing with empty knowledge base
   - ✅ Extract and chunk content first, then create clone with links

2. **Missing connection types**
   - ❌ Only create the ai_clone thing
   - ✅ Create clone_of, trained_on, and powers connections

3. **Not using thingKnowledge junction**
   - ❌ Only high-level trained_on connections
   - ✅ Create granular thingKnowledge links for each chunk

4. **Poor system prompts**
   - ❌ Generic "You are an AI assistant" prompt
   - ✅ Generate from creator profile: niche, expertise, audience, bio

5. **Forgetting events**
   - ❌ Create clone silently
   - ✅ Log clone_created, voice_cloned, appearance_cloned events

6. **Wrong knowledge types**
   - ❌ Use "document" or "vector_only" for training data
   - ✅ Use "chunk" type with embeddings for RAG

## Success Criteria

### Migration Success

- [x] All data transformed to 6-dimension ontology (things, connections, events, knowledge)
- [x] Thing counts match source system
- [x] All connections point to valid things (no orphaned records)
- [x] Event chronology is logical and complete
- [x] All verification checks pass
- [x] Feature parity achieved (everything that worked before still works)
- [x] Code uses new patterns (Convex, Effect.ts, shadcn/ui, React 19)
- [x] Documentation updated with migration notes
- [x] ID mappings preserved for reconciliation
- [x] All terminology uses "things" not "entities"

### AI Clone Success

- [x] AI clone thing created with correct type (`ai_clone`)
- [x] All required properties populated (voiceId, systemPrompt, knowledgeBaseSize, etc.)
- [x] Knowledge extracted and chunked from creator content
- [x] Embeddings generated for all chunks (1536-dim vectors)
- [x] Connection network created (clone_of, trained_on, powers)
- [x] thingKnowledge junction links created for all chunks
- [x] Events logged (clone_created, voice_cloned, appearance_cloned)
- [x] System prompt generated from creator profile
- [x] Voice and appearance cloned (or defaults set)
- [x] Status set correctly (draft → active after voice/appearance)
