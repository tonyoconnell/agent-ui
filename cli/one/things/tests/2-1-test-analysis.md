## Test Infrastructure Needs

### Required Tools

1. ✅ **Vitest** - Already installed, used by auth tests
2. ✅ **Effect.ts** - Already installed
3. ✅ **Convex Test Client** - Already used in auth tests
4. ⚠️ **Mock DataProvider** - Exists but needs enhancement
5. ⚠️ **Performance Benchmarking Tool** - Needs creation
6. ⚠️ **Test Data Generators** - Needs creation

### Required Test Environments

1. ✅ **Local Convex Dev** - Already configured
2. ⚠️ **Test Convex Deployment** - Needs separate deployment
3. ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** - Exists, may need updates

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas (Need Extra Testing)

1. **Auth Migration** (Risk: High)
   - 50+ tests must pass
   - Zero regression critical
   - Better Auth integration complex
   - **Mitigation:** Run auth tests after EVERY change

2. **Performance Overhead** (Risk: Medium)
   - 10ms budget is tight
   - Effect.ts adds abstraction cost
   - Real-time subscriptions sensitive
   - **Mitigation:** Continuous benchmarking, early optimization

3. **Multi-Tenant Isolation** (Risk: High)
   - Security critical
   - Data leaks unacceptable
   - Complex filtering logic
   - **Mitigation:** Dedicated security tests, penetration testing

4. **Type Safety** (Risk: Low)
   - TypeScript helps catch errors
   - Effect.ts provides strong types
   - Interface well-defined
   - **Mitigation:** Strict tsconfig, type-only tests
