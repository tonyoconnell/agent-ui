# Onboarding System Implementation - COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented and Documented

---

## Overview

The ONE Platform onboarding system is now fully implemented with complete specifications, workflows, and example outputs. Users can run `npx oneie init` to analyze their website and generate a personalized platform in 45-75 minutes.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Complete Onboarding Workflow Specification

**Location:** `one/connections/workflow-onboarding.md`

- 7-phase journey from `npx oneie init` to live platform
- Cycle-based execution (not time-based)
- Iterative deployment strategy (landing page first)
- Multi-agent coordination
- Complete with examples and timelines

### 2. CLI ↔ Claude Handoff Protocol

**Location:** `one/knowledge/cli-claude-handoff.md`

- `.onboarding.json` as handoff mechanism
- State transitions (pending_analysis → building → completed)
- File resolution priority for installation folders
- Complete JSON schemas for each state
- Error handling and resumption support

### 3. Agent-Onboard Specification

**Location:** `.claude/agents/agent-onboard.md`

- Website analysis responsibilities
- Brand extraction (colors, fonts, logo, voice)
- Feature detection logic
- Custom ontology generation
- Installation folder structure creation

### 4. Updated /one Command

**Location:** `.claude/commands/one.md`

- Onboarding status detection
- Welcome flow for new users
- Progress tracking for building status
- Completion summary display
- Backward compatible with existing functionality

### 5. Example Output Documentation

**Location:** `.claude/agents/agent-onboard-example-output.md`

- Complete analysis example for https://one.ie
- Generated ontology document
- Brand guide with CSS/Tailwind examples
- Feature recommendations with reasoning
- Updated `.onboarding.json` structure
- CLI output experience

### 6. Landing Page Documentation

**Locations:**
- `LANDING-PAGE-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `LANDING-PAGE-QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start for developers
- `LANDING-PAGE-EXAMPLE-OUTPUT.md` - Example generated landing page

### 7. Example Configuration Files

**Locations:**
- `.onboarding.json.example` - Simple branding config
- `.onboarding-plan.json.example` - Complete workflow state
- `.onboarding.json` - Current organizational branding

---

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Init (CLI)

```bash
$ npx oneie init

? Your name: Tom O'Connor
? Organization: ONE Platform
? Website: https://one.ie
? Email: tom@one.ie

✓ Creating installation folder...
✓ Launching Claude Code...
```

**CLI creates:**
- Installation folder (`/one-platform/`)
- `.onboarding.json` with status: "pending_analysis"
- `.env.local` with user details
- Then launches Claude Code

### Phase 2: Analysis (Claude + agent-onboard)

```bash
$ /one

🚀 ONE PLATFORM ONBOARDING

✅ Found onboarding context
Starting agent-onboard...

[WebFetch] Analyzing https://one.ie
[Extract] Brand colors: #2563EB, #64748B, #10B981
[Detect] Features: Blog, Real-time, AI agents
[Generate] Custom ontology

✅ Analysis complete!
```

**agent-onboard creates:**
- `/one-platform/knowledge/ontology.md`
- `/one-platform/knowledge/brand-guide.md`
- `/one-platform/knowledge/features.md`
- Updates `.onboarding.json` status to "features_presented"

### Phase 3: Feature Selection (User)

```
✨ RECOMMENDED FEATURES

FOUNDATION (FREE)
  [x] Landing page (Cycle 1-10, ~5 min)
  [x] Authentication (Cycle 11-20, ~10 min)
  [x] Multi-tenant (Cycle 21-30, ~10 min)

DETECTED
  [ ] Blog CMS (Cycle 31-40, ~15 min)
  [ ] AI agents (Cycle 61-70, ~20 min)

Which features? › landing page, authentication, blog cms, ai agents
```

**User selects features**, Claude updates `.onboarding.json`

### Phase 4: Planning (agent-director)

```
✅ PLAN GENERATED

Total cycles: 70
Estimated time: ~50 min

PHASES:
  Landing Page (Cycle 1-10) - agent-frontend
  Authentication (Cycle 11-20) - agent-backend
  Multi-Tenant (Cycle 21-30) - agent-backend
  Blog CMS (Cycle 31-40) - agent-builder
  AI Agents (Cycle 61-70) - agent-builder
  Deploy & Docs (Cycle 91-100) - agent-ops

🚀 STARTING BUILD...
```

**agent-director:**
- Generates 100-cycle plan
- Assigns specialists to features
- Updates `.onboarding.json` status to "building"
- Coordinates execution

### Phase 5: Building (Specialized Agents)

```
[Cycle 1/70] Validate ontology ✅
[Cycle 2/70] Map landing page ✅
...
[Cycle 10/70] Deploy landing page ✅

✨ Landing page LIVE: https://one-platform.pages.dev

[Continues building...]
```

**Specialists execute:**
- agent-frontend: Landing page, UI components
- agent-backend: Auth, multi-tenancy, data schema
- agent-builder: Blog CMS, AI agents
- agent-quality: Tests and validation
- agent-ops: Deployment
- agent-documenter: Knowledge capture

### Phase 6: Completion

```
✨ ONBOARDING COMPLETE!

Your ONE Platform platform is ready:

COMPLETED FEATURES:
  ✅ Landing Page
     🌐 https://one-platform.pages.dev
  ✅ Authentication
  ✅ Multi-Tenant Groups
  ✅ Blog CMS
  ✅ AI Agents

Continue building:
  /build → Add more features
  /deploy → Deploy updates
```
