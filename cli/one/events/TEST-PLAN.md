```

### 3.8 E2E Tests: Performance Benchmarks

**File:** `tests/demo/e2e/features/performance.spec.ts`

```gherkin
Feature: Performance Targets
  As a platform architect
  I want performance to meet standards
  So that users have fast experience

  Scenario: Demo index page loads < 1 second
    When I navigate to "/demo"
    Then page should be interactive within 1000ms
    And First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 800ms
    And Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 1200ms

  Scenario: API calls complete < 200ms
    When I perform any CRUD operation
    Then API response time should be < 200ms
    And UI should update immediately after response

  Scenario: Pagination loads quickly
    Given list has 1000+ items
    When I navigate to page 2
    Then page should load within 300ms
    And no jank or visual stuttering

  Scenario: Large list rendering efficient
    Given I have 500 items in list
    When I scroll through list
    Then frame rate should be 60+ FPS
    And memory usage should not increase > 50MB
    And DOM should have < 100 visible nodes (virtualized)

  Scenario: Search debounce working
    When I type "React hooks" character by character
    Then only final search should execute
    And search should NOT execute on every keystroke
    And search should complete within 500ms

  Scenario: Lighthouse scores
    When I audit any demo page with Lighthouse
    Then scores should be >= 95 in all categories:
      | Category   | Target |
      | Performance| 95+    |
      | Accessibility| 95+ |
      | Best Practices| 95+|
      | SEO        | 95+    |
```

### 3.9 E2E Tests: Accessibility

**File:** `tests/demo/e2e/features/accessibility.spec.ts`

```gherkin
Feature: Accessibility Compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  As a user with accessibility needs
  I want all demo pages to be accessible
  So that everyone can use the platform

  Scenario: Keyboard navigation works
    When I navigate demo pages using only Tab and Enter keys
    Then I should be able to:
      - Tab through all interactive elements
      - Activate buttons with Enter
      - Navigate lists with arrow keys
      - Close modals with Escape
    And focus should be visible (high contrast outline)

  Scenario: Screen reader compatibility
    When I use screen reader to navigate
    Then I should hear:
      - Page title
      - Navigation landmarks (nav, main, etc.)
      - Button names and states
      - Form labels
      - Table headers and cell relationships

  Scenario: Color contrast meets AA standard
    When I check all text elements
    Then contrast ratio should be >= 4.5:1 for normal text
    And >= 3:1 for large text (18px+ or 14px+ bold)

  Scenario: Images have alt text
    When I inspect all images
    Then each image should have:
      - Meaningful alt text (not "image" or "photo")
      - OR be marked as decorative with alt=""

  Scenario: Form error messages accessible
    When I submit invalid form
    Then error messages should:
      - Be clearly visible
      - Associate with form field
      - Be announced by screen reader
      - Suggest how to fix

  Scenario: Loading states announced
    When I trigger async operation
    Then aria-busy should be set to true
    And aria-label should announce "Loading..."
    And screen reader should announce completion when done
```
