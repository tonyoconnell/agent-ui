## Troubleshooting Common Release Issues

### 1. GitHub Push Protection (SECRET FOUND)

**Error:**
```
remote: error: GH013: Repository rule violations found
remote: - Push cannot contain secrets
```

**Cause:** Example credentials in documentation that look real enough to trigger scanning.

**Fix:**
```bash
# 1. Find the offending file/line from error message
# 2. Edit file to use obvious placeholders
.claude/agents/agent-ops.md:289
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your-github-token-here  # Not real

# 3. Reset git history if already committed
cd apps/one
git reset --hard <commit-before-secret>

# 4. Re-run release with fixed files
/release patch
```

### 2. TypeScript Build Errors (Icon Types)

**Error:**
```
Type 'ForwardRefExoticComponent<...>' is not assignable to '(props: SVGProps) => Element'
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Change icon type definition from:
icon: (props: React.SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>) => React.JSX.Element;

// To:
icon: React.ComponentType<React.SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>>;
```

### 3. Version Already Published

**Error:**
```
npm WARN publish Version 3.0.3 already published
```

**Fix:**
Let the release script auto-increment:
```bash
./scripts/release.sh patch  # Auto-bumps to next version
```

### 4. Web Build Fails

**Error:**
```
error: script "build" exited with code 1
6 errors
```

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
cd web
bunx astro check  # See all errors
bunx astro check 2>&1 | grep "error"  # Filter errors
```

**Common Fixes:**
- Fix TypeScript errors one by one
- Run `bunx astro sync` to regenerate types
- Check for missing `client:load` directives
- Verify import paths are correct

### 5. Cloudflare Warnings (Astro.request)

**Warning:**
```
[WARN] `Astro.request.headers` used in prerendered pages
```

**Fix (pick one):**
```astro
---
// Option 1: Make page server-rendered
export const prerender = false;

// Option 2: Remove header dependency
// Option 3: Conditional based on SSR
const headers = import.meta.env.SSR ? Astro.request.headers : null;

## Lessons Learned (v3.0.3)

1. **Security First**
   - Always use obvious placeholders in docs (`your-token-here`)
   - Pre-scan for secrets before commit
   - Git history cleanup when secrets committed

2. **TypeScript Strictness**
   - Icon types need `React.ComponentType<SVGProps>` not function signatures
   - Run `bunx astro check` before building
   - Fix all errors, don't ignore warnings

3. **Version Management**
   - Let release script handle all version bumps
   - Never manually edit package.json versions
   - Verify sync across all repos post-release

4. **Build Before Deploy**
   - Always build web before deploying to Cloudflare
   - Fix TypeScript errors first
   - Test locally before production

5. **Git History Hygiene**
   - Reset commits if secrets found
   - Re-run release to create clean history
   - Never force-push without understanding why
