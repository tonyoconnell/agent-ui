3. **Gather Feedback:** User reactions to persona-driven design

### Medium Term (This Month)

## Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are additive

- Existing pages still work

### Runtime Performance

- **Homepage:** Same as before (new sections are static)
- **Ontology:** Same as before
- **Language:** Same as before
- **Skills:** N/A (used by agents, not runtime)
