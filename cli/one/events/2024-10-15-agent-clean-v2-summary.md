# Agent Clean v2.0 - Complete Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready
**Version:** 2.0.0

## Overview

Agent Clean has been significantly enhanced with automated hooks, comprehensive metadata tagging, and deep integration into the cycle workflow and release process. It now ensures continuous cleanliness, flawless execution, and rich contextual navigation for AI agents.

---

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Pre-Cycle Validation Hook (`clean-pre.py`)

**Location:** `.claude/hooks/clean-pre.py`

**Purpose:** Validates environment cleanliness before every cycle

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Directory structure integrity validation
- ✅ File naming convention checks (kebab-case, PascalCase)
- ✅ Orphaned temporary file detection
- ✅ Metadata tag presence validation
- ✅ Git status monitoring (uncommitted critical files)
- ✅ Cleanliness scoring (0-100 scale)
- ✅ Smart blocking (only on critical errors)

**Output Example:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🟢 CLEANLINESS VALIDATION - ✨ Excellent (95/100)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  WARNINGS:
  • 3 files missing metadata tags
  • 12 uncommitted files

📊 METRICS:
  • Files Without Metadata: 3
  • Uncommitted Files: 12

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. Post-Cycle Cleanup Hook (`clean-post.py`)

**Location:** `.claude/hooks/clean-post.py`

**Purpose:** Cleans up and organizes after every cycle

**Capabilities:**
- 🧹 Remove temporary files (*.tmp, *.swp, *.bak, .DS_Store)
- 🗂️  Clean build artifacts (.astro, dist, caches)
- 📁 Organize misplaced files into correct directories
- 🏷️  Add/update metadata tags on recently modified files
- 📦 Archive old versions (.bak files → .claude/archive/)
- 📊 Track and report space savings
- 💾 Store cleanup metrics for continuous improvement

**Output Example:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🧹 CLEANUP COMPLETE - Agent Clean Post-Cycle
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 CLEANUP METRICS:
  • Files Removed: 15
  • Files Organized: 3
  • Files Tagged: 8
  • Space Freed: 2.4 MB

✅ ACTIONS TAKEN:
  Removed 15 temporary files
  Cleaned: .astro (1.8 MB)
  Moved: release-notes.md → one/knowledge/
  Tagged: one/knowledge/metadata-system.md

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. Metadata Tagging System

**Location:** `one/knowledge/metadata-system.md`

**Purpose:** Rich metadata for AI navigation and context

**Schema:**
```yaml
---
title: Document Title
dimension: [groups|people|things|connections|events|knowledge]
category: specific-category
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
version: X.Y.Z
ai_context: |
  Multi-line description for AI agents.
  Explains purpose, use cases, and navigation hints.
---
```

**12 Tag Categories:**
1. skill (typescript, react, python, design)
2. industry (fitness, education, finance)
3. topic (ai, blockchain, marketing, sales)
4. format (video, text, audio, code)
5. goal (learn, earn, build, grow)
6. audience (beginners, professionals, developers)
7. technology (astro, react-19, convex, sui)
8. status (draft, published, deprecated)
9. capability (image-gen, analysis, refactoring)
10. protocol (a2a, acp, ap2, x402, ag-ui)
11. payment (stripe, crypto, x402)
12. network (sui, solana, base, ethereum)

### 4. Metadata Tagging Automation

**Location:** `.claude/hooks/tag-all-docs.py`

**Purpose:** Automatically tag all documentation files

**Capabilities:**
- 📝 Scan all markdown files in `one/` directory
- 🔍 Cycle dimension from directory structure
- 🎯 Cycle category from subdirectories
- 🏷️  Generate tags from content analysis
- 📄 Add metadata if missing
- ♻️  Update existing metadata if incomplete
- 🧪 Dry-run mode for preview
- 📊 Comprehensive reporting

**Usage:**
```bash
# Preview changes (dry-run)
python3 .claude/hooks/tag-all-docs.py --dry-run --verbose

# Apply tags
python3 .claude/hooks/tag-all-docs.py

# Results: 398 markdown files ready to be tagged
```
