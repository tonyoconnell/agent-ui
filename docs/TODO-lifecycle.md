# TODO: Lifecycle Implementation

> **Goal:** Every agent walks the same path: Register → Signal → Highway → Crystallize.
> The substrate doesn't care what species. It tracks what happened. Code the journey.
>
> **Source of truth:** [lifecycle.md](lifecycle.md) — the 11 stages,
> [DSL.md](DSL.md) — signal language,
> [dictionary.md](dictionary.md) — canonical names,
> [rubrics.md](rubrics.md) — quality scoring (fit/form/truth/taste → mark),
> [routing.md](routing.md) — the sandwich pattern,
> [TODO-testing.md](TODO-testing.md) — testing gates every transition
>
> **Schema:** Tasks map to `world.tql` dimension 3b. Execute with `/wave`. Create with `/todo`.
>
> **Shape:** 3 cycles, four waves each. Haiku reads, Opus decides, Sonnet
> writes, Sonnet checks. Same loop as the substrate, different receivers.

## Routing

The lifecycle IS the routing. Each stage is a gate. Each gate is a test.
Signals flow through stages. Results mark paths. Tests verify transitions.

```
    INTO ONE                    THROUGH ONE                 OUT OF ONE
    ────────                    ───────────                 ──────────
    REGISTER ──→ CAPABLE        SIGNAL ──→ DROP/ALARM      CRYSTALLIZE
        │           │               │           │               │

                                    │
                              testing gates
                              every transition
                              (syncs with TODO-testing.md)
```

**Sync with TODO-testing.md:**
- Lifecycle stages have test gates (from TODO-testing.md task `test-lifecycle-gates`)
- Lifecycle tests verify stage transitions (from TODO-testing.md task `test-agent-lifecycle`)
- Green baseline required before lifecycle implementation

## Testing — The Deterministic Sandwich Around Waves

Every cycle is wrapped in deterministic checks. Tests are the PRE and POST
of the lifecycle — the same sandwich that wraps every LLM call.

```
    PRE (before W1)                    POST (after W4)
    ───────────────                    ────────────────
    npm run verify                     npm run verify
    ├── biome check .                  ├── biome check .     (no new lint)
    ├── tsc --noEmit                   ├── tsc --noEmit      (no new type errors)
    └── vitest run                     ├── vitest run        (no regressions)
                                       └── new tests pass    (exit condition verified)

    BASELINE                           VERIFICATION
    "what passes now"                  "what still passes + what's new"
```

**Depends on:** TODO-testing.md Cycle 1 (Green baseline) must be complete before
starting this TODO. Testing gates the lifecycle.

   └──────────────┘        └──────────────┘        └──────────────┘

   H = Haiku (recon)    O = Opus (decide)    S = Sonnet (edit + verify)
```

## How Loops Drive This Roadmap

Each cycle activates deeper substrate loops:

| Cycle | What changes | Loops activated |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **WIRE** | Registration works, capabilities declared | L1 (signal), L2 (path marking), L3 (fade) |
| **PROVE** | Signals route, trails form, gates work | L4 (economic) joins L1-L3 |
| **GROW** | Highways proven, crystallization on Sui, federation | L5-L7 (evolution, learning, frontier) join L1-L4 |

The cycle gate is the substrate's `know()` — don't advance until the
cycle's patterns are verified and promoted to durable learning.

---

## Source of Truth

**[lifecycle.md](lifecycle.md)** — the 11 stages, revenue at each stage
**[DSL.md](DSL.md)** — signal grammar, `{ receiver, data }`, mark/warn/fade
**[dictionary.md](dictionary.md)** — canonical names, unit/signal/path definitions
**[rubrics.md](rubrics.md)** — quality scoring: fit/form/truth/taste as tagged edges
**[TODO-testing.md](TODO-testing.md)** — testing gates every transition

| Stage | Lifecycle | Implementation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| 0 | REGISTER | `world.add(id)` + `persist.actor(id, kind, opts)` |
| 1 | CAPABLE | `capability` relation in TypeDB |
| 2 | DISCOVER | `suggest_route()` returns this unit |
| 3 | SIGNAL | `world.signal()` or `world.ask()` |
| 4 | DROP | `mark(edge, strength)` |
| 5 | ALARM | `warn(edge, resistance)` |
| 6 | FADE | `world.fade(rate)` — asymmetric decay |
| 7 | HIGHWAY | `strength ≥ 50, traversals ≥ 50` (inferred) |
| 8 | CRYSTALLIZE | `know()` → Sui transaction |
| 9 | FEDERATE | Cross-group signal routing |
| 10 | DISSOLVE | Trails fade, unit optional remove |

## Cycle 1: WIRE — Into ONE

**Files:** `src/engine/persist.ts`, `src/engine/world.ts`, `src/lib/typedb.ts`, `src/pages/api/agents/register.ts`, `src/schema/world.tql`

**Why first:** Registration is the entry point. Can't test the journey if you can't enter.

**Depends on:** TODO-testing.md task `baseline-green` (green baseline must exist).

### Tasks

- [x] Implement signal lifecycle: route → execute → mark/warn
  id: impl-signal
  value: critical
  effort: high
  phase: C2
  persona: dev
  blocks: impl-drop, impl-alarm
  exit: `world.ask()` returns 4 outcomes. Each outcome triggers appropriate mark/warn. Signal logged to TypeDB.
  tags: engine, lifecycle, P0
  done: world.ts signal() + ask() with auto-reply, tested in one.test.ts + persist.test.ts

  id: impl-drop
  value: critical
  effort: low
  phase: C2
  persona: dev
  blocks: impl-highway
  exit: `mark(edge, strength)` increases edge.strength. Chain depth scales the mark. Traversals increment.

  phase: C2
  persona: dev
  blocks: impl-highway
  exit: `warn(edge, resistance)` increases edge.resistance. isToxic check with cold-start protection.

  done: persist.ts warn() + isToxic(), tested in persist.test.ts (6 isToxic cases)

- [x] Implement fade(): asymmetric decay
  id: impl-fade
  value: high
  effort: low
  phase: C2
  persona: dev
  exit: `world.fade(rate)` decays strength by rate, resistance by 2*rate. Resistance forgives faster.
  tags: engine, lifecycle, P1
  done: persist.ts fade(), tested in routing.test.ts (asymmetric decay verified)

- [ ] Lifecycle gate: SIGNAL → DROP requires { result }
  id: gate-signal-drop
  value: high
  effort: low
  phase: C2
  persona: dev
  exit: mark() only called when ask() returns { result: X }. timeout = neutral. dissolved = mild warn. no result = full warn.
  tags: engine, lifecycle, P1

- [ ] Lifecycle gate: SIGNAL → ALARM requires failure
  id: gate-signal-alarm
  value: high
  effort: low
  phase: C2
  persona: dev
  exit: warn() called with appropriate strength: 0 for timeout, 0.5 for dissolved, 1.0 for failure.
  tags: engine, lifecycle, P1

- [x] 4 outcome types fully implemented
  id: impl-outcomes
  value: critical
  effort: medium
  phase: C2
  persona: dev

- [ ] Signal logging to TypeDB
  id: impl-signal-log
  value: high
  effort: medium
  phase: C2
  persona: dev
  exit: Every signal creates signal entity with sender, receiver, data, success, latency, timestamp.
  tags: engine, lifecycle, P1

### Cycle 2 Gate

```bash
# Verification commands
curl -X POST localhost:4321/api/signal -d '{"receiver":"test-agent:translate","data":{"text":"hello"}}'
curl localhost:4321/api/state | jq '.paths["entry→test-agent"]'
```

```
  [ ] Signal routes to test-agent
  [ ] Success marks path (strength > 0)
  [ ] Failure warns path (resistance > 0)
  [ ] Fade reduces both (resistance faster)
  [ ] Signal logged in TypeDB with latency
```

## Cycle 3: GROW — Out of ONE

**Files:** `src/engine/persist.ts`, `src/engine/sui.ts` (new), `src/pages/api/crystallize.ts` (new), `nanoclaw/src/lib/federation.ts`

**Depends on:** Cycle 2 complete. Can't crystallize without proven paths.

---

### Tasks

- [x] Implement highway detection: strength ≥ 50, traversals ≥ 50
  id: impl-highway
  value: critical
  effort: medium
  phase: C3
  persona: dev
  blocks: impl-crystallize
  exit: `isHighway(edge)` returns true when threshold met. TypeDB function `edge_classification(from, to)` returns "highway".
  tags: engine, lifecycle, P0
  done: isHighway() in one-prod.ts, highways() in world.ts, is_highway/path_status in world.tql

- [ ] Implement crystallize(): freeze highway to Sui
  id: impl-crystallize
  value: critical

- [ ] Implement dissolve(): graceful exit
  id: impl-dissolve
  value: medium
  effort: low
  phase: C3
  persona: dev
  exit: `world.remove(id)` removes unit. Paths remain and fade naturally. No penalty. Silence.
  tags: engine, lifecycle, P2

- [ ] Lifecycle gate: DROP → HIGHWAY requires threshold
  id: gate-drop-highway
  value: high
  effort: low
  phase: C3
  persona: dev
  exit: Highway status only inferred when strength ≥ 50 AND traversals ≥ 50. Early edges stay "fresh".
  tags: engine, lifecycle, P1

- [ ] Lifecycle gate: HIGHWAY → CRYSTALLIZE requires confirmed
  id: gate-highway-crystallize
  value: high
  effort: medium
  phase: C3
  persona: dev

  tags: engine, lifecycle, P1

- [ ] API endpoint: POST /api/crystallize
  id: api-crystallize
  value: high
  effort: medium
  phase: C3
  persona: dev

- [x] Sui wallet derivation: UID → keypair
  id: impl-sui-wallet
  value: high
  effort: medium
  phase: C3
  persona: dev
  exit: `addressFor(uid)` derives Sui address from SUI_SEED + uid. Same uid = same address. Deterministic.
  tags: engine, lifecycle, P1
  done: deriveKeypair(uid) in src/lib/sui.ts, HKDF-SHA256(seed||uid) → Ed25519

- [ ] ProvenCapability on-chain structure
  id: impl-proven-capability
  value: high
  effort: medium
  phase: C3
  persona: dev
  exit: Move struct matches lifecycle.md spec. Fields: agent, task, strength, completions, crystallized_at.
  tags: sui, lifecycle, P1

### Cycle 3 Gate

```bash
# Verification commands
# After 50+ successful signals
curl localhost:4321/api/state | jq '.highways'
curl -X POST localhost:4321/api/crystallize -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```
  [ ] Highway forms after 50 marks
  [ ] know() writes to Sui
  [ ] ProvenCapability on-chain matches TypeDB
  [ ] Federated signals cross group boundaries
  [ ] Dissolved unit's paths fade naturally
```

## Cost Discipline

| Cycle | Wave | Agents | Model | Est. cost share |
|-------|------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | W1 | 4 | Haiku | ~5% |
| 1 | W2 | 0 | Opus | ~0% |
| 1 | W3 | 4 | Sonnet | ~20% |
| 1 | W4 | 1 | Sonnet | ~5% |
| 2 | W1-W4 | ~6 | Mixed | ~35% |
| 3 | W1-W4 | ~7 | Mixed | ~35% |

**Hard stop:** if any Wave 4 loops more than 3 times, halt and escalate.

## Execution

```bash
# Run the next wave
/wave TODO-lifecycle.md

# Autonomous loop
/work

# The three deterministic checks
npm run verify                    # all three at once
npx biome check .                # lint + format
npx tsc --noEmit                 # type safety
npx vitest run                   # behavior
```

## Sync Points with TODO-testing.md

This TODO depends on and feeds into TODO-testing.md:

| This TODO | Requires from Testing | Produces for Testing |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Start C1 | `baseline-green` complete | Implementation to test |
| C1 gates | `test-lifecycle-gates` parallel | Gate functions to verify |
| C2 signal | `test-engine-core` parallel | ask() 4 outcomes |
| C3 crystallize | `test-persist` parallel | know() to verify |
| All cycles | Green baseline | New tests for new code |

**The loop:**
```
TODO-testing.md         TODO-lifecycle.md
────────────────        ──────────────────
baseline-green    ───►  C1 can start
                  ◄───  impl-register done
test-lifecycle    ───►  verifies gates work
                  ◄───  all gates implemented
test-agent-lifecycle ►  full journey verified
```

The substrate doesn't care what species. It tracks what happened.
Testing gates every transition. The lifecycle IS the test suite.*
