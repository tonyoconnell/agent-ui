# TODO: Self-Learning Task System

> **Goal:** Tasks are signals. Waves are loops. The template is a unit.
> Context accumulates down, quality marks flow up, the graph learns which
> task patterns succeed. Tasks check themselves off when verified.
>
> **Source of truth:** [DSL.md](DSL.md) — the signal language,
> [dictionary.md](dictionary.md) — everything named,
> [rubrics.md](rubrics.md) — quality scoring,
> [TODO-template.md](TODO-template.md) — the wave pattern
>
> **Shape:** 3 cycles, four waves each. Haiku reads, Opus decides, Sonnet
> writes, Sonnet checks. Same loop as the substrate, different receivers.

## The DSL of Tasks

Tasks speak the same language as everything else: `{ receiver, data }`.

```
DICTIONARY                          DSL
──────────                          ───
signal   = task picked from queue   signal({ receiver: 'builder:task-id', data: context })
unit     = the template executor    unit('wave-runner').on('recon', ...).then('recon', ...)
task     = .on() handler per wave   .on('recon', haiku), .on('decide', opus), .on('edit', sonnet)
mark     = wave outcome scored      mark('wave-runner:recon→wave-runner:decide', score)
path     = wave→wave connection     strength accumulates on proven wave transitions
highway  = proven wave pattern      know() promotes: "W1→W2→W3→W4 works for 'engine' tasks"
```

A TODO file is a **queue of signals**. `/wave` is the **drain**. Each wave
is a **handler** on the wave-runner unit. `.then()` carries context forward.
`mark()` records quality. `fade()` forgets what doesn't work.
`know()` promotes what does.

## Routing

```
    TASK QUEUE (TypeDB)
         │
         │  tasks_by_priority() → highest unblocked
         │
         ▼
    resolveContext(task, net)
    → DSL.md + dictionary.md (always)
    → domain docs (from tags → inferDocsFromTags)
    → hypotheses (from recall)
    → highways (proven paths filtered by tags)
    → exit condition (verification spec)
    → model (from wave/effort)
         │
         ▼                          result flows UP
    ┌─W1─W2─W3─W4─┐                ────────────────
    │ H   O  S  S  │                mark(edge:fit, s)
    └──────────────┘                mark(edge:form, s)
         │                          mark(edge:truth, s)
         │                          mark(edge:taste, s)
         ▼                               │
    exit condition met?                   │ weak dim?
    YES → selfCheckoff()                  ▼
          → mark done                fan-out signal
          → update checkbox            → specialist
          → unblock dependents         → marks own path
          → emit next signals
    NO  → re-enter W3 (max 3)
          → warn path
          → escalate
```

## Schema

Tasks in TypeDB (`world.tql` dimension 3b):

```tql
entity task,
    owns task-id @key,        # "resolve-context"
    owns name,                # "Create resolveContext function"
    owns description,         # populated by resolveContext at selection time
    owns tag @card(0..),      # ["engine", "build", "P0"]
    owns task-status,         # "open" | "active" | "done" | "blocked"
    owns task-value,          # "critical" | "high" | "medium"
    owns task-effort,         # "low" (haiku) | "medium" (sonnet) | "high" (opus)
    owns task-wave,           # "W1" | "W2" | "W3" | "W4"   ← NEW
    owns task-phase,          # "C1".."C7"
    owns task-persona,        # "ceo" | "dev" | "investor" | ...
    owns task-context,        # "dsl,routing,dictionary"      ← NEW (doc keys)
    owns priority-score,      # computed: value + phase + persona + blocking
    owns priority-formula,    # "critical=30 + C1=40 + dev=20"
    owns source-file,         # which TODO file
    owns exit-condition,      # what "done" looks like
    owns done;                # boolean

relation blocks,
    relates blocker,
    relates blocked;
```

## Dependency Graph: Waves Have Context

Each wave's output IS the next wave's input. Context accumulates via `.then()`.

**Each wave maps to `core.ts`:**

| Wave | core.ts | sense | select | act | mark |
|------|---------|-------|--------|-----|------|
| W1 | **sense** | resolveContext → files | all (parallel) | haiku reads | mark entry→recon |
| W2 | **select** | W1 reports + DSL + dict | opus decides | produce diffs | mark recon→decide |
| W3 | **act** | W2 diff specs | all (parallel) | sonnet edits | mark/warn decide→edit |
| W4 | **mark** | W3 edits | single verifier | rubric score | markDims (4 tagged edges) |

---

## Context Loading: DSL + Dictionary Always

Every W2 decision loads the DSL and dictionary as non-negotiable baseline:

```typescript
const baseContext = net.context(['dsl', 'dictionary'])     // always
const taskContext = contextForSkill(task.tags[0])           // from tags
const learned = await net.recall(task.id)                   // from graph

const envelope = {
  base: baseContext,       // DSL + dictionary (always)
  domain: taskContext,     // routing.md, loops.md, etc.
  learned,                 // hypotheses (what the graph knows)
  reports: w1Reports,      // W1 recon output (accumulated)
  exit: task.exit,         // verification spec
}
```

---

## Self-Learning: Tasks Check Themselves Off

```typescript
async function selfCheckoff(task: Task, net: PersistentWorld) {
  // 1. Mark done in TypeDB
  await markTaskDone(task.id)

  // 2. Strengthen the path
  net.mark(`loop→builder:${task.id}`, 5)

  // 3. Update the source TODO file checkbox
  await updateTodoCheckbox(task.source, task.line, true)

  // 4. Unblock dependents — emit signals
  const unblocked = await readParsed(`
    match (blocker: $a, blocked: $b) isa blocks;
    $a has task-id "${task.id}"; $b has task-id $bid, has done false;
    select $bid;
  `)
  for (const t of unblocked) {
    net.enqueue({ receiver: `builder:${t.bid}`, data: { unblocked: true } })
  }

  // 5. Phase gate — if all tasks in phase complete, crystallize
  const remaining = await readParsed(`
    match $t isa task, has task-phase "${task.phase}", has done false; select $t;
  `)
  if (remaining.length === 0) await net.know()
}
```

## How Loops Drive This Roadmap

| Cycle | What changes | Loops activated |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **WIRE** | DSL+dict loaded as base, resolveContext built, task signals enriched | L1, L2, L3 |
| **PROVE** | Waves mapped to core loop, .then() carries context, model routed per wave | L4 joins |
| **GROW** | Wave transitions mark paths, tasks self-checkoff, graph learns patterns | L5-L7 join |

The cycle gate is `know()` — don't advance until patterns are promoted.

---

## Existing Infrastructure

| File | Lines | Role | Status |
|------|------:|------|--------|
| `src/engine/core.ts` | 146 | sense→select→act→mark | Done |
| `src/engine/sources.ts` | 259 | Sense: struggling, highways, frontiers | Done |
| `src/engine/task-parse.ts` | 233 | TODO checkbox → Task[] | Done |
| `src/engine/task-sync.ts` | 173 | Task[] → TypeDB entities | Done |
| `src/engine/task-extract.ts` | 135 | Haiku one-shot: doc → TODO | Done |
| `src/engine/doc-scan.ts` | 425 | Scan docs/, verify vs code | Done |
| `src/engine/context.ts` | 265 | loadContext, contextForSkill | Done, needs inferDocsFromTags |
| `src/engine/loop.ts` | 367 | Growth tick L1-L7 | Done, needs wave integration |
| `src/engine/persist.ts` | 339 | PersistentWorld + sandwich | Done, needs markDims |
| `.claude/commands/wave.md` | 64 | Wave executor | Done |
| `.claude/commands/work.md` | 97 | Autonomous loop | Done, needs wave awareness |
| `.claude/commands/done.md` | 27 | Mark complete | Done, needs selfCheckoff |

**What's missing:** The wiring. Context doesn't flow. Waves don't map to core.ts.
Tasks don't self-checkoff. DSL + dictionary aren't baseline. Rubrics aren't tagged edges.

---

## Cycle 1: WIRE — Context into Tasks

**Files:** `src/engine/context.ts`, `src/engine/loop.ts`, `src/engine/task-parse.ts`

**Why first:** Without context in signals, everything downstream is cosmetic.

### Tasks

- [ ] Add DSL + dictionary as base context in every wave
  id: base-context-always
  value: critical
  effort: low
  phase: C1
  persona: dev
  blocks: wave-context-envelope
  exit: contextForSkill loads DSL.md + dictionary.md as baseline for all tasks
  tags: engine, build, P0

- [x] Create inferDocsFromTags in context.ts
  id: infer-docs-from-tags
  value: critical
  effort: low
  phase: C1
  persona: dev
  blocks: wave-context-envelope
  exit: engine→[dsl,routing], typedb→[dsl], ui→[dictionary], commerce→[sdk], etc.
  tags: engine, build, P0
  done: src/engine/context.ts:128 - maps tags to docs, always includes DSL+dictionary (2026-04-14)

- [x] Build resolveContext function
  id: resolve-context
  value: critical
  effort: medium
  phase: C1
  persona: dev
  blocks: enrich-task-signal
  exit: resolveContext(task, net) returns {base, domain, learned, highways, model, exit}

  done: src/engine/context.ts:160 - returns {docs, hypotheses, highways, exit, unblocks} (2026-04-14)

- [ ] Enrich task signal in loop.ts with full envelope
  id: enrich-task-signal
  value: critical
  effort: medium
  phase: C1

  id: recall-prior-attempts
  value: high
  effort: low
  phase: C1
  persona: dev
  exit: net.recall(taskId) included in envelope. Failed attempts inform next try.
  tags: engine, typedb, P1

- [ ] Wire blocking context — executor sees what it unblocks
  id: blocking-context
  value: high
  effort: low
  phase: C1
  persona: dev
  exit: task_blockers() results in signal. Builder knows its work unblocks N others.

  id: todo-skill
  value: high
  effort: low
  phase: C2
  persona: dev
  exit: /todo creates a TODO file from source doc with wave structure, DSL+dict context, schema link
  tags: engine, build, P1

*Tasks are signals. Waves are loops. The template is a unit.
Context flows down. Quality flows up. The graph learns.
Haiku reads, Opus decides, Sonnet writes, Sonnet checks.
Done tasks check themselves off and unblock the next signal.*
