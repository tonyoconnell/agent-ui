# TODO: The Deterministic Sandwich Around Everything

> **Goal:** Testing gates every lifecycle transition — for agents, humans,
> and code. Hooks enforce the loops in real time. The plan→task→test→learn→optimize
> cycle runs continuously, in parallel, at memory speed. The system brings
> agents and humans along the lifecycle and can't get dumber — only smarter.
>
> **Source of truth:** [DSL.md](DSL.md) — signal language,
> [dictionary.md](dictionary.md) — canonical names,
> [rubrics.md](rubrics.md) — quality scoring,
> [speed.md](speed.md) — the benchmarks testing must verify,
> [routing.md](routing.md) — the sandwich pattern testing extends,
> [patterns.md](patterns.md) — the 10 patterns tests prove,
> [lifecycle.md](lifecycle.md) — the journey testing gates
>
> **Schema:** Tasks map to `world.tql` dimension 3b. Execute with `/wave`. Create with `/todo`.
>
> **Shape:** 3 cycles, four waves each. Haiku reads, Opus decides, Sonnet
> writes, Sonnet checks. Same loop as the substrate, different receivers.

## Routing

Testing is the deterministic sandwich scaled up. Three layers of sandwich,
same pattern, different time scales:

```
    SIGNAL LEVEL              WAVE LEVEL               LIFECYCLE LEVEL
    (<0.001ms)                (~5s)                    (days)
    ────────────              ──────────               ────────────────
    PRE: isToxic?             PRE: bun run verify      PRE: 320 core tests
    LLM: generate             LLM: W1-W3 edits         LLM: agents run
    POST: mark/warn           POST: bun run verify     POST: crystallize to Sui

    prevents bad              prevents bad             prevents bad
    signals                   code                     patterns
```

Each layer's POST check feeds the next layer's learning:
- Signal mark/warn → pheromone → routing improves
- Test pass/fail → cycle gate → only proven cycles advance
- Highway crystallize → permanent proof → other agents learn

```
    bun run verify
         │
         ├── biome check .     → FORM (is the code shaped right?)
         ├── tsc --noEmit      → TRUTH (is the code safe?)
         └── vitest run        → FIT  (does the code work?)
                                 │
                                 └── rubric dim mapping:
                                     biome  = form  (0.20)
                                     tsc    = truth (0.30)
                                     vitest = fit   (0.35)
                                     voice  = taste (0.15) ← W4 rubric only
```

---

## The Lifecycle Loop

Testing isn't just "does the code work?" It's the gate between lifecycle
stages. Every transition — for agents, humans, and code — must pass through
a test before the signal marks the path.

```
    PLAN ──→ STORY ──→ TASK ──→ TEST ──→ LEARN ──→ OPTIMIZE
      │         │         │        │         │          │
      ▼         ▼         ▼        ▼         ▼          ▼
    /todo     context   /wave    verify    mark()     evolve
    creates   loads     executes  gates    compounds   rewrites
    TODO      DSL+dict  W1-W4    W0+W4    pheromone   prompts
      │         │         │        │         │          │
      └─────────┴─────────┴────────┴─────────┴──────────┘
                              ▲
                              │ repeat — each cycle gets smarter
```

### Testing Gates Every Lifecycle Stage

From [lifecycle.md](lifecycle.md) — each stage has a test:

| Stage | Gate | Test | Speed |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| **REGISTER** | Can receive signals? | `signal → unit exists → ack` | <1ms |
| **CAPABLE** | Has skills? | `capability relation in TypeDB` | <100ms |
| **DISCOVER** | Can be found? | `suggest_route returns this unit` | <1ms |
| **SIGNAL** | Does it respond? | `ask() → { result }` | <2s |
| **DROP** | Does mark work? | `mark() → strength increases` | <0.001ms |
| **ALARM** | Does warn work? | `warn() → resistance increases` | <0.001ms |
| **HIGHWAY** | Is path proven? | `strength ≥ 50, traversals ≥ 50` | <0.005ms |
| **CRYSTALLIZE** | On-chain? | `Sui tx confirmed` | <2s |

Each gate is a test. Pass → signal marks the path. Fail → warn. The
lifecycle IS a test suite. The test suite IS the lifecycle.

### Bringing Agents and Humans Along

Agents move through the lifecycle by doing work. Humans move through by
observing the work. Both follow the same path — pheromone doesn't care
who deposited it.

```
AGENT STORY:
  Register → first signal → first result → mark → more traffic
  → highway forms → trusted → crystallize → permanent proof

HUMAN STORY:
  Visit /world → see agents working → see highways forming
  → trust the system → use it → their signals join the graph
  → the agent that helped them gets stronger
```

Tests verify both stories at every step. The integration test is:
"Can an agent go from register to highway in N signals?" The speed
test is: "How fast?" The learning test is: "Does it get faster?"

---

## Hooks — The Nervous System of Development

Claude Code hooks enforce the loops in real time. They fire on every
tool call, gate transitions, run in parallel with the work.

```
HOOK LAYER                          SUBSTRATE LAYER
──────────                          ───────────────
PostToolUse(Write|Edit)             signal(receiver, data)
  → biome check file                 → isToxic? dissolve
  → report issues                    → capability? dissolve
  → <15s, non-blocking               → <0.001ms, non-blocking

PreToolUse(Bash)                    PRE check
  → safety gate                      → deterministic gate

TaskCompleted                       mark(edge, strength)
  → run verify                       → pheromone compounds
  → gate next task                   → routing improves
```

### Active Hooks (`.claude/settings.json`)

| Event | Matcher | Action | Blocking? |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------|
| PostToolUse | `Write\|Edit` | biome check on changed file | No (warns) |

### Planned Hooks

| Event | Matcher | Action | Blocking? |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------|
| TaskCompleted | `*` | `bun run verify` on touched files | Yes — gate |
| PreToolUse | `Bash(rm *)` | Safety check | Yes — block |
| SubagentStop | `*` | Collect results, mark path | No |
| Stop | `*` | Run verify, report regressions | No |

### The Loops Run in Synchrony

```
L1 SIGNAL     Every tool call         hook fires, checks, gates
L2 TRAIL      Every task complete     verify gates the mark
L3 FADE       Background             biome --watch, vitest watch
L4 ECONOMIC   Per deploy             cost tracked per cycle
L5 EVOLUTION  Per failing pattern    test failure → evolve prompt
L6 KNOWLEDGE  Per completed cycle    know() promotes proven wave patterns
L7 FRONTIER   Per unexplored area   coverage report shows gaps
```

All seven loops have a testing analog. They run in parallel:
- L1-L3 are instant (hooks, marks, fade) — nervous system speed
- L4-L7 are periodic (deploy, evolve, know, frontier) — brain speed
- Tests run at both speeds: biome per-edit (fast), vitest per-cycle (slow)

---

## Current Baseline (2026-04-14, post-Cycle 2)

```
VITEST:    320 tests, 320 pass, 0 failures, 19 files
BIOME:     0 warnings (all fixed)
TSC:       0 errors
COVERAGE:  src/engine/ — 19 test files (routing, persist, loop, lifecycle, context, world, llm-router, task-sync)
```

| File | Tests | Status |
|------|------:|--------|
| `src/engine/routing.test.ts` | 54 | Pass — 15 Acts: cold start → highway, introspection, speed benchmarks |
| `src/engine/persist.test.ts` | 26 | Pass — isToxic, actor, flow, sandwich, subscribe, tasksFor ranking |
| `src/engine/one.test.ts` | 25 | Pass — chains, SOPs, timers, priority, emit |
| `src/engine/context.test.ts` | 20 | Pass — CANONICAL, readDoc, loadContext, contextForSkill, docIndex |
| `src/engine/task-parse.test.ts` | 18 | Pass — priority formula, wave, context, model mappings, schema |
| `src/engine/llm-router.test.ts` | 11 | Pass — LLM routing, model selection |
| `src/engine/intent.test.ts` | 11 | Pass — intent cache |

## Cycle 1: WIRE — Green Baseline

**Files:** `src/engine/*.test.ts`, `biome.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `package.json`

**Why first:** Can't sandwich anything until the sandwich itself works.
`bun run verify` must pass before any TODO cycle can start.

## Cost Discipline

| Cycle | Wave | Agents | Model | Est. cost share |
|-------|------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | W1 | 3 | Haiku | ~5% |

## Gaps Found by Testing

Tests revealed these gaps — documented here, tracked in other TODOs:

| Gap | Found in | Impact | TODO |
|-----|----------|--------|------|
| `ask()` doesn't auto-reply for simple handlers | lifecycle.test.ts Act 1 | Wave pattern must use signal+sense, not ask for chain verification | TODO-task-management |
| `rubric.ts` doesn't exist yet | Cycle 3 recon | markDims can't be tested until rubric scorer is built | TODO-typedb |
| `unit_classification()` is TypeDB-only | lifecycle.test.ts | Can't test "proven" status in-memory — need a runtime equivalent | TODO-typedb |
| No lifecycle gate functions | Cycle 3 recon | Stage transitions aren't enforced — agents can skip stages | TODO-task-management |
| `contextForSkill()` missing `inferDocsFromTags` | context.test.ts | Tags on tasks don't auto-resolve to doc keys yet | TODO-typedb |

## Execution

```bash
# Run the next wave
/wave TODO-testing.md

# Autonomous loop
/work

# The three deterministic checks
bun run verify                    # all three at once
bun biome check .                # lint + format
bun tsc --noEmit                 # type safety
bun vitest run                   # behavior

# Watch mode for development
bun vitest watch
bun biome check --watch .

*Testing IS the lifecycle. Every stage has a gate. Every gate is a test.
Biome checks form. TypeScript checks truth. Vitest checks fit.
Rubrics check taste. Hooks enforce the loops in real time.
Plan → story → task → test → learn → optimize → test → task.
The system brings agents and humans along the same path.
The system can't get dumber — only smarter. Only faster.*
