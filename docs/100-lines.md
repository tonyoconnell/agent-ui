//    data:     what it carries     anything — or nothing
//
//  Ants carry chemical signals. Neurons fire electrical signals.
//  Agents carry digital signals. Same pattern. Same substrate.

//   ctx   — who sent this (from) and who I am (self)

// ── THE UNIT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Lines 1–8      GROUPS (Dimension 1)
               Containers. Colonies, teams, DAOs.
               Swarms nest inside swarms. Units belong to swarms.

Lines 9–20     ACTORS (Dimension 2)
               Who acts. Humans, agents, LLMs, systems.
               All are units. Status is INFERRED from performance.

Lines 21–32    THINGS (Dimension 3)
               Tasks with optional price. Task + price = service.
               Blockers form dependency chains.

Lines 33–48    PATHS (Dimension 4)
               Weighted connections. The pheromone trails.
               mark() → strength. warn() → resistance. fade() → decay.
               Unit↔unit paths. Task→task trails. Capability links.

Lines 49–55    EVENTS (Dimension 5)
               Every signal recorded. Who, what, when, how much.
               Raw data that dimensions 4 and 6 learn from.

Lines 56–64    KNOWLEDGE (Dimension 6)
               Hypotheses, frontiers. Not programmed — inferred.
               The colony's intelligence, known.

Lines 65–100   FUNCTIONS
               TypeDB 3.x uses fun, not rule. Functions are the inference layer.
               path_status() classifies: highway, fading, toxic.
               unit_status() classifies: proven, at-risk.
               optimal_route() follows the strongest path.
               highways() discovers proven paths. ready_tasks() finds work.
               The engine ACTS. The schema REMEMBERS. Functions REASON.

## The Engine Journey

```
Lines 1–10     THE SIGNAL
               Two fields. receiver + data. That's all that flows.

Lines 11–20    THE UNIT
               Anything that receives a signal. Tasks + continuations.
               .on() to handle. .then() to chain. .role() to preset.

Lines 21–45    Unit internals
               Parse receiver → find task → execute → continue.
               Missing handler? Signal dissolves. Zero returns.

Lines 46–55    THE COLONY
               Units live here. Scent (weight) accumulates here.
               No router. No queue. Just weight and time.

Lines 56–60    MARK
               Drop weight on a path. +1 per signal. The memory.

Lines 61–70    SIGNAL
               Parse → find → mark → deliver. The heartbeat.

Lines 71–75    SPAWN
               Birth a unit. Wire its emit back into world.signal.
               The loop closes.

Lines 76–82    FOLLOW
               Find the strongest trail. Route by what worked.
               Not by rules — by accumulated evidence.

Lines 83–90    FADE
               All paths decay. 10% per tick. Below 0.01? Forgotten.
               This is how the colony forgets what stopped working.

Lines 91–98    HIGHWAYS
               Query the top paths. This is the colony's intelligence.
               What survived fade is proven. What's proven is knowledge.

Lines 99–100   RETURN
               Expose everything. The colony is transparent.
               Agents can read the strength graph. The world is open.
