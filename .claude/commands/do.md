> Load it once per session. Let it orient the work.

Drive work through the substrate — select and execute.

## Modes

| Mode | What | Loop |
|------|------|------|
| `<TODO-file>` | Advance next wave of the TODO (wave-at-a-time) | L1, L2 |
| `<TODO> --auto` | Run W1→W4 continuously until all cycles done | L1, L2 |
| `<TODO> --wave N` | Run a specific wave (override auto-detect) | L1, L2 |
| *(empty)* | Autonomous loop: pick → execute → mark → repeat | L1, L2 |
| `--once` | Single iteration of the autonomous loop | L1, L2 |

## Routing

`/do` maps to `select()` + the tick loop — driving signals through the
deterministic sandwich. Every execution closes its loop per Rule 1:
mark() on result, warn() on failure, warn(0.5) on dissolved, neutral on timeout.

| Mode | Primitive | Termination |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `<TODO>` | wave handler | one wave completes |
| `--auto` | wave handler × N | all cycles complete |
| `--wave N` | wave handler | one wave completes |
| empty | `select()` | user interrupts |
| `--once` | `select()` | one task completes |

## Steps

### `<TODO-file>` — Wave execution

Pass a TODO filename as `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. `/do TODO-commands.md`).
If no argument given, use the most recently modified `docs/TODO-*.md` (excluding TODO-template.md).

Read `docs/<TODO-file>`. Find the current cycle and wave by scanning the Status section
for the first unchecked `- [ ]` wave entry. Execute that wave:

**W0 — Baseline (before first wave of any new cycle)**

```bash
bun run verify   # biome check . && tsc --noEmit && vitest run
```

Record: tests passed/total, any known failures. Fix before proceeding. Don't build on broken ground.

---

**W1 — Recon (Haiku, parallel)**

1. Read the TODO's Wave 1 section for the current cycle
2. Spawn ALL recon agents **in a single message** using the Agent tool with `model: "haiku"`
3. Each agent reads one file and reports findings verbatim with line numbers
4. Hard rule for each agent: "Report verbatim. Do not propose changes. Under 300 words."
5. Collect all reports
6. Mark Wave 1 complete in the Status section: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`

Log: `W1: tasks_parallel=N  marked=N  warned=N  dissolved=N`

---

**W2 — Decide (Opus, main context)**

1. You ARE the decider. Do not delegate this wave.
2. Read all W1 reports + the source-of-truth doc referenced in the TODO
3. For each finding, decide: **Act** (produce anchor + new text) or **Keep** (it's an exception)
4. Output diff specs:
   ```
   TARGET:    docs/foo.md
   ANCHOR:    "<exact old text>"
   ACTION:    replace
   NEW:       "<new text>"
   RATIONALE: "<one sentence>"
   ```
5. Mark Wave 2 complete

Log: `W2: decisions=N  fan_out=N`

---

**W3 — Edits (Sonnet, parallel)**

1. Read the diff specs from Wave 2
2. Spawn ALL edit agents **in a single message** using the Agent tool with `model: "sonnet"`
3. Each agent gets: file path, anchor (exact old_string), replacement, and the rule:
   "Use Edit tool with exact anchor as old_string. Do not modify anything else.
   If anchor doesn't match, report dissolved."
4. Collect results — mark successful edits, warn on anchor mismatches
5. Re-spawn dissolved agents once with corrected anchors (read the file first)
6. Mark Wave 3 complete

Log: `W3: edits_parallel=N  marked=N  warned=N  dissolved=N  reloops=N`

---

**W4 — Verify (Sonnet, single)**

1. **Deterministic checks first:**
   ```bash
   bun run verify   # biome + tsc + vitest
   ```
   If any check fails on files touched in W3, route failure back to W3 (max 3 loops).

2. Spawn ONE verification agent (`model: "sonnet"`) — reads all touched files and checks
   cross-consistency per the TODO's verify checklist
3. Agent scores rubric: fit / form / truth / taste (each 0–1, gate at ≥ 0.65)
4. If clean → mark Wave 4 `[x]` → mark cycle `[x]`
5. If inconsistencies → spawn micro-edit agents (Wave 3.5) → re-verify (max 3 loops total)

Log: `W4: rubric={fit, form, truth, taste}  delta_vs_W0={...}  verify=green|red`

---

**After each wave:**
- Update TODO Status section (`[x]`)
- Report: `{ marked: N, warned: N, dissolved: N }`
- If all 4 waves complete: "Cycle N complete. Run `/do TODO-file` for next cycle."
- If all cycles complete: "All cycles complete."

**Rules:**
- Never skip W2. Understanding is not delegable.
- Always spawn W1 and W3 agents in a SINGLE message — this is how you get parallelism.
- W4 max 3 loops. If still failing after 3, halt and report to user.

---

### `--auto`

Same as `<TODO-file>` but runs W1→W2→W3→W4 continuously until all cycles are marked `[x]`.
Stop only if W4 loops > 3 (escalate to user). Report cycle completion after each.

### `--wave N`

Force a specific wave (1–4) regardless of the Status section.
Useful for re-running a failed wave or skipping ahead.

---

### *(empty)* — Autonomous loop

```
W0: bun run verify (once per session, skip if already passed)

ORIENT: Read docs/TODO.md
        → note the active front (Atomicity / Vocabulary / New Surfaces)
        → note the Top 15 priority list
        → let this shape which task you pick

loop:
  SENSE:    GET http://localhost:4321/api/tasks
            Sort by priority (effective = score + strength − resistance)
            Skip blocked tasks (blockedBy non-empty)

  SELECT:   Pick highest unblocked (P0 > P1, attractive > ready > exploratory)
            If all blocked: GET /api/state → follow pheromone highways (deadlock escape)

  EXECUTE:  Do the work (edit files, write code, run scripts as needed)

  VERIFY:   bun tsc --noEmit on touched files

  MARK:     POST http://localhost:4321/api/tasks/{id}/complete

  CLOSE:    POST http://localhost:4321/api/loop/close { score: rubric }
            Score rubric: fit / form / truth / taste (each 0–1)

  DIMS:     POST http://localhost:4321/api/loop/mark-dims { fit, form, truth, taste }
            Dims < 0.5 → warn on that dimension path
            Dims ≥ 0.5 → mark on that dimension path

  FEEDBACK: POST http://localhost:4321/api/signal {
              receiver: 'loop:feedback',
              data: {
                tags: task.tags,         // what kind of work this was
                strength: rubricAvg,     // how well it went (avg of 4 dims)
                content: { task_id, rubric, outcome: 'result' }
              }
            }
            // The return-path signal — lays pheromone on the trail home.
            // Future select() with matching tags follows this trail.
            // strength >= 0.65 → mark each tag path
            // strength < 0.65 → warn(0.5) each tag path (try specialist)
            // Always emit — even timeout, even dissolved. Every loop closes.

  GROW:     GET http://localhost:4321/api/highways → report learned paths

  → repeat
```

After each task: report name, strength, priority, tests passed, unlocked tasks.

### `--once`

Single iteration of the autonomous loop above.
Pick one task → execute → mark → stop.
Report: name, strength, priority, tests, deterministic outcome (result/timeout/dissolved/failure).

*`/do` is `select()` made human-readable. The path remembers every execution.*
